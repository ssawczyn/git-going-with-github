## 1. Installing GitHub Mobile

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| iOS (iPhone / iPad) | [App Store - GitHub](https://apps.apple.com/app/github/id1477376905) |
| Android | [Google Play - GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android) |

After installing, sign in with your GitHub account. Enable notifications when prompted - these are essential for staying on top of PR reviews and issue activity without constantly checking the web.

---

## 2. Getting Around the App

GitHub Mobile is organized into five main tabs at the bottom of the screen:

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| Home | Personalized feed of activity across your repositories |
| Notifications | All @mentions, review requests, issue updates |
| Explore | Discover repositories and trending projects |
| Pull Requests | PRs assigned to you, created by you, or awaiting your review |
| Profile | Your profile, repositories, stars, and settings |

Navigate between tabs with a single tap (or swipe on iOS with VoiceOver active).

---

## 3. VoiceOver on iOS

### Enabling VoiceOver

- **Triple-click the side button** (iPhone X and later) or triple-click the Home button to toggle VoiceOver
- Or: Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver → toggle on

### Basic Gestures in GitHub Mobile

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Swipe right | Move to the next element |
| Swipe left | Move to the previous element |
| Double tap | Activate the focused element |
| Two-finger swipe up | Read from the top |
| Two-finger tap | Pause/resume speech |
| Three-finger swipe left/right | Move between screens |
| Scrub (two-finger Z motion) | Go back |

### Rotor in GitHub Mobile

Open the Rotor by rotating two fingers on the screen as if turning a dial. Useful rotor settings for GitHub Mobile:

- **Headings** - jump between section headings on an issue or PR description
- **Links** - navigate to linked issues, commits, or external URLs
- **Form Controls** - jump to input fields when writing a comment
- **Actions** - available actions for the focused element (assign, label, close)

### Writing Comments with VoiceOver

1. Navigate to the comment field (swipe to it or use Rotor → Form Controls)
2. Double tap to activate and open the keyboard
3. Type your comment; VoiceOver announces each character
4. When done, swipe to the **Comment** button and double tap to submit

---

## 4. TalkBack on Android

### Enabling TalkBack

- Settings → Accessibility → TalkBack → toggle on
- Or: hold both volume keys for three seconds (if the shortcut is enabled)

### Basic Gestures in GitHub Mobile

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Swipe right | Move to next element |
| Swipe left | Move to previous element |
| Double tap | Activate the focused element |
| Swipe up then down | Scroll down |
| Swipe down then up | Scroll up |
| Swipe right then left | Go back |
| Two-finger swipe down | Read from top |

### TalkBack Menu

Tap with three fingers (or swipe down then right) to open the TalkBack menu. From here you can:

- Change the reading granularity (character, word, line, paragraph)
- Activate reading controls
- Copy text

### Writing Comments with TalkBack

1. Locate the comment field - TalkBack announces "Edit text, double tap to edit"
2. Double tap to enter the field
3. Use the on-screen keyboard or dictation to type
4. Locate the **Comment** button and double tap to submit

---

## 5. Working with Notifications

GitHub Mobile's Notifications tab is one of its strongest features for AT users - it surfaces all activity in a clean, linear list that is much easier to navigate than the GitHub web notifications page.

### Inbox Management

- **Swipe left** on a notification to reveal quick actions: Mark as read, Archive, Unsubscribe
- **Swipe right** to mark as done
- Tap a notification to open the full issue or PR

### Filtering Notifications

Use the filter icon at the top right to filter by:
- Type (Issues, PRs, Releases, etc.)
- Repository
- Reason (you were @mentioned, a review was requested, etc.)

With VoiceOver or TalkBack, the filter controls are accessible form elements. Open the filter panel, navigate to each option, and activate to toggle it.

## 6. Reviewing Pull Requests

Mobile is well suited for quick PR reviews - approving straightforward changes, leaving a comment, or checking CI status while away from your desk.

### Navigating a PR

When you open a pull request, the screen is divided into sections:
- **Description** - the PR body with any images or checklists
- **Commits** - individual commits in this PR
- **Files changed** - a simplified diff view
- **Checks** - CI/CD status

VoiceOver and TalkBack announce these as headings. Use heading navigation (Rotor on iOS, swipe granularity on Android) to jump between sections.

### Leaving a Review

1. Scroll to or navigate to the **Review changes** button
2. Double tap to open the review panel
3. Choose Approve, Request changes, or Comment
4. Add an optional comment in the text field
5. Activate **Submit review**

### Viewing Diffs

The Files Changed tab shows a simplified diff - additions and removals are text-only (no table layout). Each changed line is announced as "Added: [content]" or "Removed: [content]", which is generally more accessible than the web diff table on small screens.

---

## 7. Working with Issues

### Filing an Issue

1. Navigate to the repository
2. Tap **Issues** → the **+** button or **New Issue**
3. Fill in the title and body
4. Optionally assign labels, assignees, and milestone - each is a tappable field
5. Tap **Submit**

### Finding Your Issues

- Pull Requests tab → **Created by you** or **Assigned to you** filters
- For issues: Home feed shows recent activity; or navigate to a specific repository → Issues → filter by Assignee, Label, or Author

## 8. What Mobile Does Well vs. Desktop

| Task | Mobile | Desktop |
|------|--------|---------|
| Triage notifications | Excellent - linear list, swipe actions | Good |
| Quick review / approve a PR | Good | Good |
| Writing long PR descriptions | Fair - small keyboard | Better |
| Reviewing large diffs | Fair - simplified view | Better |
| Filing a simple issue | Good | Good |
| Complex issue templates | Fair | Better |
| Managing labels and milestones | Good | Good |
| Reading code | Fair - no syntax highlighting | Better |
| Running Codespace / editing code | Not supported | Supported |

**Best use of GitHub Mobile:** notification triage, quick approvals and comments, catching up on activity between sessions. For writing substantial code, descriptions, or reviewing complex diffs, use the web or VS Code.

---

## 9. Common Issues and Workarounds

**VoiceOver skips some PR descriptions:**
Long PR descriptions with images, tables, or embedded videos may not read cleanly. Open the PR in Safari instead - tap the **…** menu → **Open in Browser**.

**TalkBack does not announce new notifications badge:**
The badge count on the Notifications tab updates live but may not be announced. Navigate directly to the Notifications tab to get the current count read aloud.

**The keyboard covers the comment field:**
Usual iOS/Android behavior - scroll up slightly after the keyboard appears, or rotate to landscape mode to gain more visible space.

**Can't find the Submit button after writing a review:**
Scroll down past the text field; buttons are below the keyboard dismiss area. On iOS, tap elsewhere to dismiss the keyboard first, then scroll to Submit.

**GitHub Mobile crashes or freezes:**
Force close the app and reopen. If the problem persists, sign out and back in via Profile → Settings → Sign out.
