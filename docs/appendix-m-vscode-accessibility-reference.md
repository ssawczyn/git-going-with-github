## 1. Complete Accessibility Settings Reference

All settings can be accessed via Settings UI (`Ctrl+,`) or by editing `settings.json` directly (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Open User Settings JSON").

### Core Accessibility Settings

| Setting Path | Values | Default | Description |
| --------------  | --------  | ---------  | -------------  |
| `editor.accessibilitySupport` | `auto`, `on`, `off` | `auto` | Enables screen reader optimizations. `auto` detects NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver. Set to `on` to force. |

2. Add custom sound paths:

```json
{
  "accessibility.signals.lineHasError.sound": "file:///C:/Users/YourName/sounds/error.wav",
  "accessibility.signals.taskCompleted.sound": "file:///C:/Users/YourName/sounds/success.wav",
  "accessibility.signals.diffLineInserted.sound": "file:///C:/Users/YourName/sounds/added.wav"
}
```

#### Sound file requirements

- Format: WAV, MP3, or OGG
- Duration: Keep under 2 seconds
- Volume: Normalize to avoid clipping


## 3. Accessible Diff Viewer - Complete Guide

The Accessible Diff Viewer presents file diffs as a structured, line-by-line list instead of a visual side-by-side view.

### When to Use Accessible Diff Viewer

- Reviewing pull request changes
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Comparing file versions (Timeline view)
- Reviewing Copilot-generated edits
- Any time you need to understand what changed in a file

### Opening Accessible Diff Viewer

| Method | Steps |
| --------  | -------  |
| Keyboard (in diff editor) | Press `F7` to jump to first hunk, `Alt+F2` to open Accessible View |
| Command Palette | `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Open Accessible Diff Viewer" |
| Automatic | Some contexts open it automatically in screen reader mode |

### Diff Viewer Structure

#### Top-level structure

##### Description

The Accessible Diff Viewer starts with a header showing the file path and change summary. It then shows each hunk (changed section) in order. Each hunk contains: the hunk location (line range), unchanged context lines, the modified, added, or removed lines with their prefix, and more context lines. After all hunks, a footer shows the totals for additions and deletions.

#### Line prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning | Screen Reader Announcement |
| --------  | ---------  | ----------------------------  |
| (no prefix) | Unchanged line (context) | "Unchanged: [line content]" |
| `+` | Added line | "Added: [line content]" or "Line added: [content]" |
| `-` | Removed line | "Removed: [line content]" or "Line removed: [content]" |
| `\|~` | Modified line (original) | "Modified from: [old content]" |
| `\|+` | Modified line (new version) | "Modified to: [new content]" |

### Navigating Hunks

#### Hunk = a block of related changes

| Action | Keyboard |
| --------  | ----------  |
| Jump to next hunk | `F7` |
| Jump to previous hunk | `Shift+F7` |
| Jump to next change | `F8` (in some contexts) |
| Jump to previous change | `Shift+F8` |

### Screen Reader-Specific Navigation

#### NVDA/JAWS

1. Open diff: `Enter` on file in Source Control, or `F7` in an open diff
2. `Alt+F2` to open Accessible Diff Viewer
3. Navigate with `Up/Down Arrow` (line by line)
4. Use `H` key to jump between hunks (each hunk has a heading)
5. `Escape` to close and return to editor

#### VoiceOver

1. `VO+Arrow` to navigate to diff file → `VO+Space` to open
2. `Option+F2` for Accessible Diff Viewer
3. `VO+Arrow` keys to navigate lines
4. `VO+Command+H` to jump between hunk headings
5. `Escape` to close

### Understanding Context Lines

The diff shows 3 unchanged lines before and after each change for context. These are announced as "Unchanged: [content]".

#### Example

```text
Hunk 1 of 3 - lines 42-48

  Unchanged: ## Screen Reader Setup
  Unchanged:
- Removed: This guide covers NVDA only.
+ Added: This guide covers NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.
  Unchanged:
  Unchanged: ### Installing NVDA
```

The unchanged lines help you understand where in the file the change occurred.

### Inline Diff View vs Side-by-Side

#### Inline view (recommended for screen readers)

- All changes in a single editor
- Removed lines followed by added lines
- Easier to navigate with screen reader reading commands

#### Side-by-side view (default, visual)

- Left panel: original file
- Right panel: modified file
- Requires navigating between panels

#### To switch to inline view

1. Open Settings: `Ctrl+,`
2. Search: "diffEditor.renderSideBySide"
3. Uncheck the box (or set to `false` in settings.json)


## 4. Screen Reader-Specific Configurations

### NVDA Configuration for VS Code

## 6. Accessibility Signals Types and Customization

Accessibility signals are events that trigger announcements or audio cues. Beyond audio cues, VS Code has verbal announcements for various events.

### Announcement Verbosity Settings

Control how much information VS Code announces:

| Setting | Values | Default | Controls |
| ---------  | --------  | ---------  | ----------  |
| `accessibility.verbosity.diffEditor` | `verbose`, `minimal`, `off` | `verbose` | Diff viewer context announcements |
| `accessibility.verbosity.editor` | `verbose`, `minimal`, `off` | `verbose` | General editor announcements |
| `accessibility.verbosity.hover` | `verbose`, `minimal`, `off` | `verbose` | Hover popup announcements |
| `accessibility.verbosity.inlineCompletions` | `verbose`, `minimal`, `off` | `verbose` | Copilot suggestion announcements |
| `accessibility.verbosity.terminal` | `verbose`, `minimal`, `off` | `verbose` | Terminal operation announcements |

**`verbose`:** Announces full context and details  
**`minimal`:** Announces only essential information  
**`off`:** No automatic announcements (use Accessible View manually)

### Custom Announcement Timing

Control when and how often announcements occur:

| Setting | Values | Default | Description |
| ---------  | --------  | ---------  | -------------  |
| `accessibility.signals.debouncePositionChanges` | number (ms) | `500` | Delay before announcing position changes (prevents spam during rapid navigation) |
| `accessibility.signals.onDidChangeFocus` | boolean | `true` | Announce focus changes |
| `accessibility.signals.onDidChangeModelContent` | boolean | `false` | Announce content changes (very verbose) |

### Signal Priorities

When multiple signals occur simultaneously, VS Code prioritizes them:

1. **Errors** (highest priority) - always announced
2. **Warnings** - announced after errors
3. **Completions** - announced if no errors/warnings
4. **Focus changes** - announced last

This prevents overlapping announcements.


## 7. Settings.json Configuration Examples

The configuration examples below are JSON blocks you paste into your `settings.json` file. To apply a complete set at once, consider using **VS Code Profiles** -- named configuration bundles that let you switch your entire setup instantly. See [Chapter 5, Section 9: Profiles](05-vscode-accessibility.md#profiles) for how to create, switch, export, and share profiles.

### Minimal Screen Reader Profile

#### For users who prefer minimal announcements and use Accessible View manually

```json
{
  "editor.accessibilitySupport": "on",
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "editor.renderWhitespace": "none",
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
