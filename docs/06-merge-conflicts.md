## Understanding, Preventing, and Resolving Conflicts

> Merge conflicts sound intimidating but are a normal, manageable part of collaborative development. This guide explains what conflicts are, how to read conflict markers, and how to resolve them - step by step.

## What Is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two people have both changed the **same part of the same file** in **different ways**, and Git cannot automatically decide which version is correct.

Git can merge changes automatically when they touch different parts of a file. Conflicts only happen when two changes overlap - for example:
- Person A changed line 12 to say "Submit form"
- Person B changed line 12 to say "Send message"
- Git asks: which one do you want to keep?

## Why Conflicts Happen

The most common causes:

| Cause | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Two people edited the same line | You both fixed the same typo differently |
| One person deleted a file but another edited it | You removed an old function; they fixed a bug in it |
| Two people restructured the same section | You reorganized a list; they added items to it |
| A long-running PR diverged from main | Your branch is weeks old and main has changed significantly |

## How to Prevent Conflicts (Prevention is Easier Than Resolution)

Avoiding conflicts in the first place saves time and reduces stress. Here are the most effective strategies:

### 1. **Keep your branches short-lived**

Work in small, focused chunks. A branch that lives for 3 days has far fewer conflicts than one that lives for 3 weeks.

- Target: 1-3 days from branch to merge
- If a feature takes longer, break it into smaller PRs

### 2. **Sync with main frequently**

The longer your branch diverges from main, the more likely conflicts become.

**Best practice:** Sync daily if main is active:

```bash
# From your feature branch:
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# Or: git rebase origin/main (if comfortable with rebasing)
```

**GitHub web method:** Use the "Update branch" button on your PR if it appears.

### 3. **Communicate with your team**

Let others know what files you're working on. Use issue comments:

> "Heads up: I'm working on the `[TODO]` sections in `docs/welcome.md` for Challenge 3. If you're also editing welcome.md, let's coordinate so we don't conflict."

In the Learning Room, this is especially important because multiple students may claim challenges that touch the same file. Challenges 1 and 3 both modify `docs/welcome.md` - if two students work on both simultaneously without coordinating, a merge conflict will occur.

### 4. **Avoid mass reformatting**

Running a formatter on an entire file creates conflicts with anyone else editing that file. If you must:

- Do it in a **separate PR** before functional changes
- Announce it to the team
- Merge it quickly so everyone can sync

### 5. **Pull before you push**

Always fetch and merge (or pull) before pushing your changes:

```bash
git pull origin main  # Sync your local main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main        # Merge main into your branch
git push              # Now push
```

This catches conflicts locally where they're easier to resolve.

### 6. **Work on separate files when possible**

If multiple people are working simultaneously, divide tasks by files or modules rather than everyone touching the same code.

### 7. **Keep PRs small**

A 50-file PR will almost certainly conflict with something. A 5-file PR merges quickly and cleanly.

The most effective contributors make many small PRs rather than one giant one.

### 8. **Use Draft PRs for early visibility**

Open your PR as a draft while still working. Others can see what you're changing and avoid overlapping work. Convert to "Ready for review" when done.

## Advanced Prevention: Understanding Fast-Forward Merges

When your branch is perfectly up to date with main and adds new commits on top, GitHub can do a "fast-forward" merge - main simply moves forward to your latest commit. No merge commit needed. No possibility of conflicts.

**How to achieve this:** Rebase your branch on main right before merging:

```bash
git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease  # See warning below about force pushing
```

**Warning:** Force pushing rewrites history. Only do this on branches you alone control (not shared branches). Never force push to `main`.

For more on force pushing and rebasing, see the [Glossary](appendix-a-glossary.md#force-push).

---

## When Conflicts Are Actually Good

Conflicts indicate that multiple people are actively improving the project. In a healthy, collaborative environment, occasional conflicts are normal and manageable.

If you never have conflicts, it might mean:
- You're the only contributor (less review, less learning)
- PRs are moving too slowly (stagnation)
- People are avoiding working on important files (technical debt)

**The goal isn't zero conflicts.** The goal is catching them early, resolving them cleanly, and learning patterns that reduce future conflicts.

## Spotting a Conflict on GitHub

When a PR has a merge conflict, you will see this message on the Conversation tab, near the merge section:

> “This branch has conflicts that must be resolved”

You will also see a “Resolve conflicts” button. If you cannot see it (it may require write access), contact the PR author.

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

Scroll to the bottom of the Conversation tab. The conflict message appears as a yellow or orange banner above the merge button area. Click **Resolve conflicts** to open the web conflict editor.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS - Windows)</summary>

1. Press `D` to reach the bottom of the Conversation tab
2. Navigate down with `H` or `↓` past the comment threads
3. Find the heading or region containing "This branch has conflicts"
4. Press `B` to find the **Resolve conflicts** button → `Enter`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (VoiceOver - macOS)</summary>

1. `VO+U` → Landmarks or `VO+Down` to move toward the bottom of the Conversation tab
2. Quick Nav `H` or `VO+Cmd+H` past comment headings until you reach the conflict notice
3. Quick Nav `B` to find the **Resolve conflicts** button → `VO+Space`

</details>

## Conflict Markers - What They Mean

When conflict markers appear in a file, your editor is showing you both versions of the conflicted content so you can choose. The format is always:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
The content that is on YOUR current branch
=======
The content coming from the OTHER branch (or main)
>>>>>>> branch-name-or-commit-hash
```

**Breakdown:**
- `<<<<<<< HEAD` - the start of YOUR version (HEAD = "the branch you are currently on")
- `=======` - the dividing line between the two versions
- `>>>>>>> branch-name` - the end of the INCOMING version (from the branch being merged in)

### Example in a real file

**Original file (`docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md`) before conflict:**
```markdown
| Insert+Space | Toggle between Browse Mode and Focus Mode |
```

**After two students both added a shortcut to the same table row:**

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
| Insert+Space | Toggle between Browse Mode and Focus Mode |
| Insert+F5 | List elements by type |
=======
| Insert+Space | Toggle between Browse Mode and Focus Mode |
| Insert+F7 | Elements list (links, headings, form fields) |
>>>>>>> add-nvda-shortcut
```

**Resolution options:**
1. Keep your version: add only `Insert+F5`
2. Keep their version: add only `Insert+F7`
3. Keep both rows: add both shortcuts to the table (often the right answer when two students added different valid shortcuts)

## Resolving Conflicts on GitHub (Web Editor)

GitHub has a built-in conflict editor that you can use without any local tools.

### Step-by-step: GitHub Conflict Editor

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

1. Click **Resolve conflicts** on the PR Conversation tab
2. GitHub opens a full-page text editor showing each conflicted file
3. The conflict markers are highlighted - everything between `<<<<<<` and `=======` is your version; between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` is the incoming version
4. Edit the content directly: delete the lines you don’t want, including the three marker lines (`<<<`, `===`, `>>>`)
5. When the file looks correct, click **Mark as resolved** (top-right of the file)
6. If there are multiple conflicted files, a file list on the left lets you jump between them
7. After all files are resolved, click **Commit merge**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS - Windows)</summary>

1. Activate the **Resolve conflicts** button from the PR Conversation tab
2. GitHub opens the conflict editor - a full-page text editor
3. Navigate between conflicted files using the file list (press `NVDA+F7` or `VO+U` to find the file navigation panel)
4. Switch to Focus Mode (`NVDA+Space`) to enter the text editor
5. Read the conflict markers line by line with `↓`:
   - `<<<<<<< HEAD` marks the start of your version
   - `=======` is the dividing line
   - `>>>>>>> branch-name` marks the end of the incoming version
6. Edit to keep the desired content - delete the conflict marker lines and the version you don't want
7. `Tab` to **Mark as resolved** button → `Enter`
8. Repeat for all conflicted files
9. `Tab` to **Commit merge** button → `Enter`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (VoiceOver - macOS)</summary>

1. Activate the **Resolve conflicts** button from the PR Conversation tab
2. GitHub opens the conflict editor - a full-page text editor
3. `VO+U` → navigate to the file navigation panel to switch between conflicted files
4. `VO+Shift+Down` to interact with the text editor
5. `VO+Down` to read the conflict markers line by line:
   - `<<<<<<< HEAD` marks the start of your version
   - `=======` is the dividing line
   - `>>>>>>> branch-name` marks the end of the incoming version
6. Edit to keep the desired content - delete the conflict marker lines and the version you don't want
7. `VO+Shift+Up` to stop interacting, then `Tab` to **Mark as resolved** → `VO+Space`
8. Repeat for all conflicted files
9. `Tab` to **Commit merge** → `VO+Space`

</details>

### What it looks like in the editor

When the conflict editor opens, your screen reader will announce a text editor. In Focus Mode, navigate with arrow keys. The content reads:

```text
<  <  <  <  <  <  <  H  E  A  D
<button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</button>
=  =  =  =  =  =  =
<button type="submit">Send message</button>
>  >  >  >  >  >  >  f  e  a  t  u  r  e  /  f  o  r  m - i  m  p  r  o  v  e  m  e  n  t  s
```

*(Note: screen readers may spell out the `<` and `>` characters letter by letter - this is normal)*

## Resolving Conflicts in VS Code (Day 2)

VS Code has excellent merge conflict tooling with full screen reader support. This is covered in depth in [Git & Source Control in VS Code](11-git-source-control.md), but here is an overview:

### VS Code shows conflicts as:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD (Current Change)
Your version
||||||| original                   ← (3-way merge, if enabled)
Original version before both edits
=======
Incoming version
>>>>>>> branch-name (Incoming Change)
```

### VS Code merge conflict actions

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

When your cursor is on a conflict region, VS Code shows **CodeLens action links** above the conflict block in the editor:
- **Accept Current Change** - keeps your version (HEAD)
- **Accept Incoming Change** - keeps the branch version being merged
- **Accept Both Changes** - keeps both (stacked one after the other)
- **Compare Changes** - opens a side-by-side diff

Click the link you want. The conflict markers disappear and your chosen content remains. Save the file with `Ctrl+S`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS - Windows)</summary>

1. Open the conflicted file
2. Press `↓` to navigate to a conflict marker (`<<<<<<<`)
3. The CodeLens links appear above - press `Tab` to reach them
4. Press `Enter` on your chosen action
5. Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)
6. Stage the resolved file: `Ctrl+Shift+G` → find the file → **Stage changes**
7. Commit the merge

**GitHub Copilot can help:** With the cursor in a conflict region, open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) and type: "Resolve this merge conflict - keep meaningful changes from both sides." Copilot will suggest a resolution that you can review and accept.

</details>

## When You Feel Stuck

### Ask for help - it's normal

If you are unsure which version to keep:
1. Leave a comment on the PR: "I have a merge conflict in `filename.js` and I'm not sure which version to keep - could someone help me understand the intent of these two changes?"
2. Tag the PR author or a maintainer with `@username`

### Abandon and start fresh (nuclear option)

If a conflict is severe (the branch diverged a lot from main):
1. Close the PR without merging
2. Start a new branch from the latest `main`
3. Apply only your intended changes to the new branch
4. Open a new PR

This is legitimate - not a failure.

## Reading a Conflict Message from Git (Command Line Reference)

If you work locally, `git merge` or `git pull` will say:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

And `git status` will show:

```
both modified: src/index.html
```

These are normal outputs. The conflict markers are inserted into the file by Git - open the file and follow the steps above.

<details>
<summary>Git CLI alternative - resolving conflicts in the terminal</summary>

Resolve merge conflicts entirely from the command line:

```bash
# 1. Start the merge that causes the conflict
git merge main

# 2. See which files have conflicts
git status
# Look for "both modified:" entries

# 3. Open each conflicted file in your editor
# Edit the file: remove <<<<<<, =======, >>>>>> markers
# Keep the content you want

# 4. After editing, mark the file as resolved
git add src/index.html

# 5. Complete the merge
git commit
# Git auto-fills the merge commit message

# Check the result
git log --oneline -3
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>GitHub CLI (gh) alternative - checking PR conflict status</summary>

Check whether a PR has conflicts without opening a browser:

```bash
# View PR status (shows merge state)
gh pr view 42

# Check all PR checks and merge readiness
gh pr checks 42

# View the diff to understand what changed
gh pr diff 42
```

If conflicts exist, the `gh pr view` output shows "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved." Resolve locally using `git merge` (above) then push, or use the web editor.

</details>

## Summary Checklist

```
Before you start:
  □ My PR is small and focused (fewer conflicts = easier life)
  □ I checked that others aren't editing the same files

When you see a conflict:
  □ Don't panic - conflicts are normal
  □ Read both versions (between <<< and ===, and between === and >>>)
  □ Decide: keep one, keep both, or combine intelligently
  □ Remove ALL three conflict marker lines (<<<, ===, >>>)
  □ Verify the final file makes sense
  □ Mark as resolved → Commit merge

After resolving:
  □ Re-check that the PR description and issue link are still accurate
  □ Comment on the PR: "Resolved merge conflict - kept both the aria-label and type attribute"
  □ Request re-review if reviewers already approved before the conflict was introduced
```

## Try It: Read a Conflict (Without Fear)

**Time:** 2 minutes | **What you need:** Any text editor or just read below

Read this merge conflict aloud. The goal is not to resolve it - just to understand what you're hearing:

```
The button should have an
<<<<<<< HEAD
aria-label="Submit form"
=======
aria-label="Send your response"
>>>>>>> feature-branch
attribute for screen readers.
```

Answer these three questions:
1. **What does your branch say?** (The text between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`)
2. **What does the other branch say?** (The text between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`)
3. **Which version would you keep, and why?**

**You're done.** You just read a merge conflict. That's the entire skill - everything else is just choosing which lines to keep and deleting the three marker lines.

> **What success feels like:** Conflicts aren't mysterious anymore. They're just two versions side by side with markers telling you which is which. You already know how to pick the right one.

> ### Day 2 Amplifier - Copilot Chat & Conflict Prevention
>
> **Resolve at least one conflict completely by hand before using any AI assistance.** You must be able to read `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers and understand what each version represents. An AI-suggested resolution you cannot independently verify is a liability - you are accepting a change you do not understand into a codebase other people depend on.
>
> Once you have mastered manual conflict resolution:
> - **In VS Code** - Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) can explain a conflict in plain language - *"Person A renamed the button to 'Submit Form'; Person B renamed it to 'Send Message'. Which intent should take priority?"* - but you decide what survives
> - **In your repo** - Accessibility Agents' `@pr-review` can identify high-risk overlapping changes before a conflict occurs, flagging when two contributors are editing the same file area and giving you time to coordinate before it escalates
> - **In the cloud** - GitHub Agentic Workflows can detect stale PRs diverging from `main` and automatically notify contributors with a suggested rebase checklist - preventing the conflict before it is ever introduced
>
> *Understanding conflict markers is not a stepping stone to letting AI handle conflicts. It is the skill that tells you when AI got it wrong.*
