# GitHub Copilot
## AI-Powered Code Assistance in VS Code

> **Day 2, Block 2-3 Material**
>
> This guide covers GitHub Copilot: inline code suggestions, Copilot Chat (conversational assistance), custom instructions vs custom agents, effective prompting for non-code contributions, and using Accessible View to read AI-generated responses.
>
> **Prerequisites:** [VS Code Setup & Accessibility Basics](10-vscode-basics.md), [Git & Source Control in VS Code](11-git-source-control.md)

> **Mac keyboard shortcuts:** Throughout this chapter, all `Ctrl+` shortcuts use `Cmd+` on Mac, and `Alt+` shortcuts use `Option+` on Mac. Key equivalents: `Ctrl+Shift+I` → `Cmd+Shift+I` (Chat), `Ctrl+I` → `Cmd+I` (inline chat), `Alt+F2` → `Option+F2` (Accessible View), `Ctrl+/` → `Cmd+/` (insert suggestion). See the [Keyboard Shortcuts Reference](#8-keyboard-shortcuts-reference) at the end of this chapter for the complete list.

## 1. What is GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that suggests code and text completions as you type. It can:

- Complete lines of code or documentation
- Generate entire functions or sections of text from comments
- Answer questions about code in your workspace
- Explain complex code in plain language
- Draft documentation, issue responses, and commit messages
- Search for files and symbols across your workspace

**For this workshop:** Copilot helps with Markdown documentation, issue triage, PR descriptions, and commit messages - not just code.

**Copilot Free tier:** Available for all GitHub users. Provides access to inline suggestions and Copilot Chat with usage limits. No payment required for this workshop.

**Screen reader support:** Copilot is fully accessible with screen readers. Suggestions are announced via ARIA live regions, and Accessible View provides complete access to Chat responses.

---

## 2. Installing GitHub Copilot

### Installation Steps

1. Open Extensions sidebar: `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+X`)
2. Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat"
3. Find **GitHub Copilot Chat** (publisher: GitHub)
4. Press `Enter` to open the extension detail page
5. `Tab` to "Install" button → press `Enter`
6. Wait for installation to complete

**One extension, all features:** GitHub Copilot Chat is now the single all-in-one extension. It provides inline code suggestions, the Chat panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`), inline chat (`Ctrl+I` / Mac: `Cmd+I`), and all agent features. The older separate "GitHub Copilot" extension has been deprecated.

### Signing In

After installation:

1. VS Code prompts: "Sign in to use GitHub Copilot"
2. Navigate to the notification or click the Copilot icon in the status bar
3. Select "Sign in to GitHub"
4. Your browser opens for GitHub authentication
5. Authorize the Copilot extension
6. Return to VS Code

**Verify activation:**
- Bottom-right status bar shows Copilot icon (looks like `><`)
- Icon should be active (not grayed out)
- If grayed out, click it to sign in

### Checking Subscription Status

**Command Palette:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Copilot: Check Status"
3. Select it to see your subscription tier (Free, Pro, Enterprise)

**Free tier includes:**
- Completions and multi-line suggestions
- Copilot Chat
- Limited monthly usage (usually sufficient for documentation work)

---

## 3. Inline Suggestions - Ghost Text Completions

Copilot suggests completions as you type, displayed as gray "ghost text" after your cursor. In screen reader mode, VS Code announces suggestions rather than showing them visually.

### How Inline Suggestions Work

**While typing:**
1. Copilot analyzes your context (file content, cursor position, nearby files)
2. Generates a suggestion
3. Presents the suggestion

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

The suggestion appears as **gray "ghost text"** after your cursor - a preview of what Copilot thinks you want to type next. It's there but not inserted; press `Tab` to accept it or `Escape` to dismiss.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver)</summary>

Suggestions are **announced via ARIA live regions** - ghost text is not visually meaningful to you so VS Code reads it instead:
- **NVDA/JAWS:** "Suggestion available" (or reads the suggestion text, depending on verbosity settings)
- **VoiceOver:** Announces suggestions in accessible form

Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`) to open the suggestion in **Accessible View** - this gives you the complete suggestion text in a static, fully readable panel without streaming.

</details>

### Accepting Suggestions

| Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Accept entire suggestion | `Tab` | `Tab` |
| Reject suggestion | `Escape` | `Escape` |
| Accept one word at a time | `Ctrl+Right Arrow` | `Cmd+Right Arrow` |
| Show next alternative suggestion | `Alt+]` | `Option+]` |
| Show previous alternative suggestion | `Alt+[` | `Option+[` |
| Open full suggestion list | `Ctrl+Enter` | `Cmd+Enter` |
| Open suggestion in Accessible View | `Alt+F2` | `Option+F2` |
| Insert suggestion from Accessible View at cursor | `Ctrl+/` | `Cmd+/` |

**Accepting word-by-word (`Ctrl+Right Arrow` / Mac: `Cmd+Right Arrow`) is particularly useful when:**
- The suggestion starts correctly but you want to finish differently
- You want to review the suggestion incrementally
- You're learning and want to see how Copilot structures responses

### Reading Suggestions with Screen Readers

> **Visual users:** If Copilot's ghost text is getting in the way, skip to "Disabling Inline Suggestions" below.

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users - tuning announcement verbosity</summary>

**If suggestions are announced too frequently or are intrusive:**

**NVDA:**
1. NVDA Menu → Preferences → Settings → Presentation
2. Find "Report dynamic content changes"
3. Reduce verbosity level or set specific delays

**JAWS:**
1. Settings Center → HTML/PDF/Accessibility
2. Adjust "Auto Forms Mode" and "ARIA Live Region" settings

**VoiceOver:**
1. VoiceOver Utility → Verbosity
2. Reduce "Announcements" level

**Alternative: Use Accessible View**
Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`) when a suggestion appears to read it in the Accessible View (full text, no streaming).

</details>

### Prompting Through Comments

Copilot reads inline comments as instructions. For Markdown files:

```markdown
<!-- Write a step-by-step guide for screen reader users on how to create a GitHub issue -->
```

Type this comment, press `Enter`, and Copilot drafts content based on your instruction. You review, edit, and refine.

**Example prompts for this workshop:**

```markdown
<!-- Explain how to navigate the GitHub Issues list with NVDA -->

<!-- Create a checklist for accessible Markdown documentation -->

<!-- Write alt text for a screenshot showing the GitHub PR review interface -->

<!-- Draft a commit message for fixing heading hierarchy in GUIDE.md -->
```

### Disabling Inline Suggestions

If suggestions are distracting:

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

**Temporarily (current language):**
- Click the Copilot icon in the status bar (bottom-right `><` icon)
- Select "Disable Completions for [language]"

**Permanently:**
- Open Settings: `Ctrl+,` (Mac: `Cmd+,`) → search "Copilot enable" → uncheck "Enable Inline Suggestions"

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver)</summary>

**Temporarily (current language):**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`) → type "Copilot: Disable Completions" → press `Enter`
- Or navigate to the Copilot status bar item and activate it (depends on screen reader and focus)

**Permanently:**
- `Ctrl+,` (Mac: `Cmd+,`) → search "inline suggestions" → toggle off "GitHub Copilot: Enable Inline Completions"

</details>

## 4. GitHub Copilot Chat - Conversational Assistance

Copilot Chat is a full conversation interface where you ask questions, request explanations, and have content drafted.

### Opening Copilot Chat

**Primary panel:** `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`)

Opens the Chat panel on the right side of VS Code.

**Inline chat (in-file):** `Ctrl+I` (Mac: `Cmd+I`)

Opens a chat prompt directly in the editor, anchored to your cursor. Results appear inline. Best for file-specific edits.

**Quick Chat (floating):** `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+I` (macOS)

Opens a floating chat dialog that doesn't take up sidebar space.

### Chat Modes

Copilot Chat has four modes, selected from a dropdown at the bottom of the Chat input area. Each mode changes how Copilot interprets your request and what it can do.

| Mode | How It Works | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Ask** (default) | Conversational Q&A - Copilot explains, suggests, and answers but does not edit files directly | Questions, explanations, understanding unfamiliar code, reviewing content |
| **Edit** | You define a "working set" of files; Copilot proposes edits and shows a diff you approve or reject - nothing changes without your confirmation | Targeted, multi-file changes where you want full control |
| **Agent** | Copilot works autonomously - it decides which files to open, reads and writes code, and runs terminal commands to complete the task | Larger tasks where you want Copilot to drive end-to-end |
| **Plan** | Copilot produces a step-by-step implementation plan before writing any code; you review and approve the plan first | Complex features where you want to validate the approach before any changes are made |

**Switching modes:**
- The mode selector is a dropdown at the **bottom of the Chat input area**, just above the text field
- Tab through the toolbar at the bottom of Chat to find it, or click on the current mode name
- Screen reader users: the mode name is announced when you focus that control; press `Space` or `Enter` to open the dropdown, then `Arrow` keys to choose

**Recommended mode for beginners:** Start with **Ask** to learn how Copilot responds to your questions, then explore **Edit** mode for making changes with full visibility into what Copilot touches. **Agent** mode is powerful but works best once you're comfortable reviewing its output.

> **Note:** **Plan** mode was introduced in October 2025 (VS Code 1.106) and is available as a public preview. Plan mode lets you get an AI-generated implementation plan before any code is written - useful for understanding what a complex change will involve.

### Choosing a Model

Copilot gives you access to AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), xAI (Grok), and others. The **model picker** is a button at the bottom of the Chat input area, next to the mode selector, showing the current model name (e.g., "Auto" or "Claude Sonnet 4.6").

**When "Auto" is selected** (the default), Copilot automatically chooses the best model for each request - lighter models for quick questions, more capable models for complex reasoning. Auto mode has been generally available since December 2025. You can override it whenever you want a specific model.

**Quick guidance:**
- **Free-tier users:** GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 mini are available at no cost and handle most everyday tasks well
- **Need deep reasoning/debugging?** Try Claude Sonnet 4.6 or GPT-5.2 (1× premium requests)
- **Running Agent mode?** GPT-5.1-Codex-Max or GPT-5.2-Codex are optimized for autonomous tasks
- **High cost to avoid unless needed:** Claude Opus 4.6 (3× cost) - powerful but reserve for the most demanding work

For the complete model comparison, strengths, weaknesses, and plan availability, see [Appendix X: GitHub Copilot AI Models Reference](appendix-x-copilot-models.md).

### Chat Interface Structure

**Panel layout (top to bottom):**

1. **Chat input field** (multi-line text area)
   - Type your prompt here
   - Press `Ctrl+Enter` (Mac: `Cmd+Enter`) or `Enter` to send

2. **Model selector dropdown**
   - Choose which AI model to use (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - Some models better for code, others for prose

3. **Conversation history**
   - Shows your previous prompts and Copilot's responses
   - Navigate with `Up/Down Arrow`
   - Each message is a separate element

4. **Action buttons**
   - "Clear Chat" - start a new conversation
   - "View in Editor" - open response in a new file

### Screen Reader Navigation in Chat

**NVDA/JAWS:**
- Chat input is a web-based text field
- Switch to Forms Mode (`Enter` or automatic when focused)
- Type your prompt
- Press `Ctrl+Enter` to send
- Response appears in a live region (announced as it streams in)
- For complete reading: press `Alt+F2` for Accessible View

**VoiceOver:**
- `VO+Tab` to navigate to chat input
- `VO+Shift+Down` to interact
- Type prompt, `Return` to send
- `VO+Escape` to stop interacting
- Navigate down to response area
- For complete reading: `Alt+F2` for Accessible View

### What to Ask Copilot Chat

**For this workshop (non-coding examples):**

| Goal | Example Prompt |
|------|----------------|
| Understand a file | `Explain what @10-vscode-basics.md covers in plain language` |
| Improve documentation | `This section is unclear. Rewrite it for a first-time contributor using a screen reader: [paste text]` |
| Check tone | `Review this PR description for tone. Is it clear, respectful, and helpful? Suggest improvements.` |
| Draft content | `Write a section on keyboard navigation in VS Code for screen reader users` |
| Explain an error | `I got this error when trying to commit: [paste error]. What does it mean and how do I fix it?` |
| Generate alt text | `Write alt text for this image: [describe what's in the image]` |
| Create checklist | `Create an accessibility review checklist for Markdown documentation` |
| Review for accessibility | `Check this Markdown for accessibility issues: [paste content]` |

### Using @ Mentions in Chat

**@ symbols let you provide context to Copilot:**

| Mention | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `@workspace` | Searches your entire workspace for context |
| `@filename.md` | References a specific file |
| `#file` | Lists files to select from |
| `#selection` | References your currently selected text |
| `#terminalLastCommand` | References the last terminal command and output |

**Example prompts with context:**

```
Explain what @README.md covers for a new contributor

Review #selection for accessibility issues

Search @workspace for all references to "screen reader mode"

What does this error mean? #terminalLastCommand
```

### Using Slash Commands

Type `/` in Copilot Chat to see available commands:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/explain` | Explains selected code or text |
| `/fix` | Suggests fixes for problems in selected code |
| `/tests` | Generates tests (for code files) |
| `/help` | Shows all available commands |
| `/clear` | Clears chat history |
| `/savePrompt` | Saves the current chat conversation as a reusable `.prompt.md` file |

**Example:**
1. Select a block of complex Markdown
2. Open Chat: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`)
3. Type `/explain`
4. Copilot explains the structure and purpose

---

## 5. Effective Prompting for Documentation Work

Copilot works best with clear, specific prompts. The more context you provide, the better the response.

### Anatomy of a Good Prompt

**Bad prompt:**
```
Write about accessibility
```

**Good prompt:**
```
Write a 3-paragraph section explaining how screen reader users can navigate the VS Code Explorer sidebar. Include keyboard shortcuts for NVDA and JAWS. Assume the reader has never used VS Code before. Use clear headings and bullet points.
```

**What makes it good:**
1. **Specific scope:** "3-paragraph section"
2. **Clear topic:** "navigate the VS Code Explorer sidebar"
3. **Target audience:** "screen reader users" who "never used VS Code"
4. **Required details:** "keyboard shortcuts for NVDA and JAWS"
5. **Format guidance:** "headings and bullet points"

### Prompting Patterns for This Workshop

**Pattern 1: Contextual Rewrite**

```
This section is too technical for beginners. Rewrite it in plain language:

[paste existing text]

Target audience: Screen reader users trying VS Code for the first time
```

**Pattern 2: Generate with Constraints**

```
Write a step-by-step guide for creating a GitHub issue using only keyboard navigation. Include:
- NVDA screen reader announcements
- Exact keyboard shortcuts
- What to do if the form field is not announced correctly
Format as a numbered list
```

**Pattern 3: Review and Improve**

```
Review this PR description for:
1. Clarity for maintainers
2. Respect and positive tone
3. Whether it links to the related issue
4. If it explains WHY the change matters

Here's the description:
[paste your PR description]
```

**Pattern 4: Accessibility Audit**

```
Check this Markdown for accessibility problems:
- Heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3, no skips)
- Link text (no "click here" or bare URLs)
- Alt text for images
- List structure

[paste Markdown content]
```

**Pattern 5: Draft from Outline**

```
Write a section based on this outline:

## Timeline View - File History
- What Timeline shows
- How to open it (keyboard)
- How screen readers announce each commit
- How to view a specific commit's changes

Write for screen reader users. Use H3 subheadings. Include a table for keyboard shortcuts.
```

### Iterating on Responses

Copilot's first response is a draft. Refine it:

**Follow-up prompts:**

```
Make it shorter - reduce to 5 bullet points

Add more detail about what NVDA announces at each step

Rewrite this in a more friendly tone

Add a "Common Mistakes" section at the end

Format this as a table instead of a bulleted list
```

Copilot remembers the conversation context - just say what to change.

## 6. Custom Instructions vs Custom Agents

Two distinct tools shape how Copilot behaves. Understanding the difference is critical for working with Accessibility Agents (see [Chapter 16: Accessibility Agents](16-accessibility-agents.md)).

### Custom Instructions

**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Purpose:** Always-on background guidance for every Copilot interaction.

**What they do:**
- Apply to all code suggestions automatically
- Set project-wide standards
- Influence tone and style
- Provide context about your project's conventions

**Example `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:**

```markdown
# Copilot Instructions for accessibility-agents

## Accessibility Standards
- Include semantic HTML elements in generated markup
- Add ARIA labels to interactive components when no visible text is present
- Ensure keyboard navigation patterns are implemented for custom widgets

## Documentation Style
- Write for screen reader users first
- Include keyboard shortcuts for NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- Use active voice and imperative mood ("Press Ctrl+G" not "You can press Ctrl+G")
- Structure content with clear headings (H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)

## Commit Message Format
- Follow conventional commits: `type: description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123"

## Tone
- Friendly but professional
- Direct and actionable
- Assume readers are competent but may be new to this specific tool
```

**When active:** Every time Copilot generates a suggestion (inline or in Chat)

**You never have to ask for these - Copilot simply follows them.**

### Custom Agents

**Files:** `.github/agents/[name].agent.md`

**Purpose:** On-demand, focused workflows that you deliberately invoke.

**What they do:**
- Perform specific, repeatable tasks
- Can access specific tools (GitHub API, file system, terminal)
- Generate structured output (reports, reviews, analysis)
- Execute multi-step workflows

**Example agent names:**
- `@daily-briefing` - Summarize repository activity
- `@issue-tracker` - Find and prioritize issues
- `@pr-review` - Generate PR review documentation
- `@analytics` - Team contribution metrics
- `@insiders-a11y-tracker` - Monitor accessibility changes

**When active:** Only when you type `@agent-name` in Copilot Chat

See [Chapter 16: Accessibility Agents](16-accessibility-agents.md) for complete agent documentation.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Custom Instructions | Custom Agent |
|---|---|---|
| **When active** | Background - every interaction | On-demand - you type `@agent-name` |
| **Defined in** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/agents/[name].agent.md` |
| **Tool access** | Standard Copilot tools | Can restrict or grant specific permissions |
| **Best for** | Broad coding standards and preferences | Focused, repeatable, specialized tasks |
| **Requires invocation** | No - always on | Yes - explicit trigger |

### Using Both Together

**Custom instructions** ensure Copilot follows your accessibility standards on every suggestion.

**Custom agents** handle specific workflows like auditing, issue tracking, or automated remediation.

**Example workflow:**
1. Your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` says: "Always check heading hierarchy in Markdown"
2. You invoke `@insiders-a11y-tracker` to scan recent changes
3. The agent finds a heading skip (H1 → H3)
4. You ask Copilot Chat to fix it: "Fix the heading hierarchy in this file"
5. Copilot's fix follows your custom instructions (uses semantic HTML, adds ARIA where needed)

**Both work together - instructions guide every response, agents automate specific workflows.**

---

### Writing Accessibility-Focused Custom Instructions

> Source: [accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/copilot-instructions/](https://accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/copilot-instructions/)

Custom instructions can be set at three levels. Each level cascades to narrower scopes:

| Level | Where | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Organization** | Copilot organization settings | Applies to all repositories in the org |
| **Repository** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Overrides org instructions; applies to one repo |
| **Personal** | GitHub.com → Settings → Copilot → Instructions | Your own preferences; highest priority |

#### Do's - What Makes Instructions Effective

**Use normative language: MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT**

Most language models respond well to normative language. These terms reduce ambiguity and make rules clearly mandatory versus optional - the same approach WCAG itself uses:

```
## Keyboard Navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts SHOULD NOT override high-priority browser or OS shortcuts.
- A keyboard shortcut MUST use at most 4 simultaneous keys.
- All interactive components MUST be reachable by Tab key.
```

**Focus on team-specific standards, not generic principles**

Copilot already knows WCAG. Tell it what *your team* does specifically:

```
This application MUST conform to WCAG 2.2 Level AA.
DeprecatedButton SHOULD NOT be used; use NewAccessibleButton instead.
```

**Use lists and checklists to structure instructions**

Lists provide clear guardrails - Copilot follows them step by step:

```text
## Checklist for evaluating 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
- [ ] role="presentation" MUST NOT be applied to semantic elements.
- [ ] Error messages MUST be programmatically associated with inputs.
- [ ] Name-value pairs MUST NOT use headings; use <p>.
```

**Reference and enforce your design system**

Document which components to use and which are deprecated. Design systems evolve - keep instructions current:

```
Use AccessibleModal from @company/ui-kit@3.x.
LegacyDialog MUST NOT be used in any new code.
```

#### Don'ts - Common Instruction Mistakes

**Don't paste entire WCAG guidelines**

Copilot is already trained on WCAG. Pasting the full text wastes context space and dilutes your specific instructions. Instead, write concise, actionable rules that give *net-new* information: your team's specific practices, exceptions, and priorities.

**Don't reference external links**

By default, Copilot does not access external links in custom instructions - this is a deliberate security feature. A URL like `https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/` will not be fetched. Write the relevant rule directly.

**Don't reference private repositories**

Copilot cannot access private repository content from within custom instructions unless the content is already present in the active repo.

#### Additional Guidance

**Role-based prompting** - You can give Copilot a persona to shape how it responds:

```
As the lead accessibility expert on your team, your primary focus is ensuring
all UI is accessible by default, relying on semantic HTML before ARIA attributes.
```

Be specific about skills and responsibilities; avoid broad personas that may introduce unintended assumptions.

**Keep instructions concise.** There is no hard character limit, but overly long instructions reduce precision. Summarize the most important, actionable rules rather than listing every possible guideline.

**Contribute effective instructions** to [github.com/github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) so others benefit from your organization's work.

## 7. Using Accessible View with Copilot Responses

Copilot Chat responses stream in token by token. This is visually nice but can fragment screen reader announcements. **Accessible View** provides complete, structured access to generated content.

### Why Use Accessible View for Copilot

**Without Accessible View:**
- Responses announced in fragments as tokens arrive
- Live region updates may interrupt or overlap
- Difficult to re-read specific parts
- Context can be lost in streaming

**With Accessible View (`Alt+F2` / Mac: `Option+F2`):**
- Full complete response in a readable pane
- Navigate with `Up/Down Arrow` at your own pace
- Code blocks properly formatted
- Headings and lists structured
- No interruptions or live region noise

### Recommended Workflow

**Every time you ask Copilot something:**

1. Type your prompt in Chat input
2. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (Mac: `Cmd+Enter`) to send
3. Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`) to open Accessible View - you can open it immediately after sending, before the response finishes
4. Follow along as the response streams in the Accessible View in real-time
5. Read or re-read any section with `Arrow` keys
6. Press `Escape` to close Accessible View and return to Chat

> **VS Code December 2025 update:** The Accessible View now updates dynamically as responses stream in. You no longer need to wait for a response to finish before opening it - open `Alt+F2` right after sending and follow the response as it arrives.

**Benefits:**
- Follow responses live without waiting
- Navigate and re-read at your own pace
- Code blocks and lists are properly structured
- Headings are announced correctly

### Accessible View for Inline Suggestions

**When a suggestion appears:**

1. Don't accept it immediately
2. Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`)
3. Accessible View shows: "Suggestion: [full text of the suggestion]"
4. Read it completely
5. To insert the suggestion at your cursor: press `Ctrl+/` (Mac: `Cmd+/`)
6. To close without inserting: press `Escape`, then `Tab` to accept or `Escape` to reject

**`Ctrl+/` (Mac: `Cmd+/`) inserts the suggestion directly from Accessible View** - you don’t need to close the view first and then press `Tab`. This is the recommended workflow for screen reader users.

**This is especially useful for multi-line suggestions where the ghost text is hard to review.**

### Code Blocks in Accessible View

When Copilot suggests code or Markdown:

**In Accessible View:**
- Code blocks are in `<pre>` elements
- Screen readers announce "code block" or "pre-formatted text"
- Each line is on its own line (not run together)
- Indentation is preserved

**NVDA/JAWS:** Use `Arrow` keys to read line by line. Use `Ctrl+Home` to jump to the start.

**VoiceOver:** Interact with the code block (`VO+Shift+Down`) to read each line with proper structure.

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Not Suggesting Anything

**Issue:** No suggestions appear as you type.

**Solutions:**
1. Check Copilot is active: status bar icon should not be grayed out
2. Click the Copilot icon → verify "Completions enabled"
3. Check subscription status: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copilot: Check Status"
4. Restart VS Code
5. Sign out and sign back in: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copilot: Sign Out"

### Suggestions Are Too Frequent/Distracting

**Issue:** Constant interruptions from suggestions.

**Solutions:**
1. Use word-by-word acceptance: `Ctrl+Right Arrow`
2. Reduce screen reader verbosity (see Section 3)
3. Use Accessible View (`Alt+F2`) to review suggestions without live announcements
4. Disable inline suggestions temporarily: Copilot icon → "Disable Completions"

### Chat Responses Not Announced

**Issue:** Screen reader silent when Copilot responds.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for response to complete, then press `Alt+F2` for Accessible View
2. Check ARIA live region settings in your screen reader
3. Navigate manually to the response area with `Tab` or `Arrow` keys
4. Use Quick Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I`) instead of panel chat

### "Copilot Subscription Required"

**Issue:** Extension installed but asks for subscription.

**Solutions:**
1. Sign in to GitHub: Copilot icon → "Sign in"
2. Verify GitHub account has Copilot access (free tier or paid)
3. Check [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot) for subscription status
4. Free tier users: ensure you haven't exceeded monthly limits

## Try It: Your First Copilot Conversation

**Time:** 3 minutes | **What you need:** VS Code with Copilot Chat extension installed

1. **Open Copilot Chat** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`). Your screen reader announces the chat panel.
2. **Ask a question** - Type: `What does the CONTRIBUTING.md file in this repository say about how to submit a pull request?` Press `Enter`.
3. **Read the response** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to open the Accessible View if your screen reader doesn't read the response automatically. The response appears as plain text you can arrow through.
4. **Try a follow-up** - Type: `Summarize that in 3 bullet points` and press `Enter`. Copilot remembers the context from your first question.

**You're done.** You just had a conversation with an AI about your codebase.

> **What success feels like:** Copilot answered a real question about real files in your repository. You can use this same pattern to ask about code, documentation, or anything else in the project - and the Accessible View ensures you can always read the response.
