> **Listen to Episode 14:** [GitHub Copilot](../PODCASTS.md) - a conversational audio overview of this chapter. Listen before reading to preview the concepts, or after to reinforce what you learned.

## AI-Powered Code Assistance in VS Code

> **Day 2, Block 2-3 Material**
>
> This guide covers GitHub Copilot: inline code suggestions, Copilot Chat (conversational assistance), custom instructions vs custom agents, effective prompting for non-code contributions, and using Accessible View to read AI-generated responses.
>
> **Official GitHub Accessibility Guides:** GitHub publishes two developer guides and an NVDA-focused screen reader guide for Copilot:
>
> - [Using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code with a Screen Reader](https://accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/github-copilot-vsc/) - NVDA-specific setup, audio cues, inline suggestions, inline chat, chat view, and built-in actions
> - [Optimizing GitHub Copilot for Accessibility with Custom Instructions](https://accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/copilot-instructions/) - writing effective custom instructions at org, repo, and personal levels
> - [Getting Started with GitHub Copilot Custom Agents for Accessibility](https://accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/getting-started-with-agents/) - creating and invoking custom agents in VS Code and on GitHub.com
>
> This chapter covers the same material with additional perspectives and workshop context. Use the official guides as companion references.
>
> **Prerequisites:** [VS Code Setup & Accessibility Basics](05-vscode-accessibility.md), [Git & Source Control in VS Code](11-git-source-control.md)
>
> **Mac keyboard shortcuts:** Throughout this chapter, all `Ctrl+` shortcuts use `Cmd+` on Mac, and `Alt+` shortcuts use `Option+` on Mac. Key equivalents: `Ctrl+Shift+I` → `Cmd+Shift+I` (Chat), `Ctrl+I` → `Cmd+I` (inline chat), `Alt+F2` → `Option+F2` (Accessible View), `Ctrl+/` → `Cmd+/` (insert suggestion). See the [Keyboard Shortcuts Reference](#8-keyboard-shortcuts-reference) at the end of this chapter for the complete list.


## Workshop Recommendation (Chapter 13)

> ** Free to Use:** GitHub Copilot Free tier is included with all GitHub accounts at no cost. This workshop uses only the free tier. If you're on an organization with GitHub Enterprise, you may have Copilot Pro included—either way, you're covered.

Chapter 13 introduces **GitHub Copilot** for AI-assisted documentation and writing.

- **Challenge count:** 3 guided challenges
- **Automation check:** none (tool configuration is account-local and account-specific)
- **Evidence:** issue comment with checklist of completed actions
- **Pattern:** install, prompt, apply, reflect

### Chapter 13 Challenge Set

1. **Install GitHub Copilot and sign in** - add the Copilot Chat extension and authenticate.
2. **Ask Copilot to explain a codebase** - clone the sci-fi themes repo and use Copilot Chat to understand it.
3. **Ask Copilot to create something new** - prompt Copilot to generate a custom theme and apply it.

### Challenge 13.1 Step-by-Step: Install and Sign In

**Goal:** Install the GitHub Copilot Chat extension and verify it responds to prompts.

**Where you are working:** VS Code desktop with the [learning-room](https://github.com/Community-Access/learning-room) repository open.

**Estimated time:** 3-5 minutes.

1. Open the Extensions sidebar: `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Type `GitHub Copilot` in the search box and press `Enter`.
3. Find **GitHub Copilot** (publisher: GitHub) in the results. Activate **Install**.
4. VS Code may also install **GitHub Copilot Chat** automatically. If not, search for it separately and install it.
5. After installation, VS Code prompts you to sign in. Activate **Sign in to GitHub** and complete the OAuth flow in your browser.
6. Verify Copilot is active: open Copilot Chat with `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`). Type `Hello, are you working?` and press `Enter`. Copilot should respond.

**Screen reader tip:** The Copilot Chat panel opens as a sidebar. Your screen reader announces responses as they stream in. Press `Alt+F2` (Accessible View) to read the full response in a plain text buffer if streaming is hard to follow.

**You are done when:** Copilot Chat responds to a test prompt.

### Challenge 13.2 Step-by-Step: Explain a Codebase

**Goal:** Use Copilot Chat to understand an unfamiliar repository by asking targeted questions.

**Where you are working:** VS Code with the sci-fi themes repository cloned.

**Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes.

1. Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run `Git: Clone` and paste: `https://github.com/community-access/vscode-sci-fi-themes.git`
3. Open the cloned repository when VS Code prompts.
4. Open Copilot Chat: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`).
5. Ask Copilot: "What does the `chat.agent.thinking.phrases` setting do in VS Code?"
6. Read the response. Use `Alt+F2` (Accessible View) if needed to read the full text.
7. Ask a follow-up: "How do I apply one of these themes to my settings.json?"
8. Follow Copilot's instructions to apply one theme to your `settings.json` file.

**You are done when:** You have asked Copilot at least two questions and applied one setting change.

### Challenge 13.3 Step-by-Step: Create Something New

**Goal:** Use Copilot as a creative collaborator to generate a custom config and apply it.

**Where you are working:** VS Code with Copilot Chat open.

**Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes.

1. Open Copilot Chat: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`).
2. Type a creative prompt: "Create a custom GitHub Copilot thinking phrases theme for [your favorite universe - Dune, Marvel, Studio Ghibli, Star Trek, etc.]"
3. Read Copilot's generated theme. It should include an array of themed phrases.
4. Copy the generated content: select all text in the Copilot response, then `Ctrl+C` (Mac: `Cmd+C`).
5. Open your `settings.json`: Command Palette, then `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.
6. Paste the theme configuration into your settings.
7. Save with `Ctrl+S` and reload VS Code: Command Palette, then `Developer: Reload Window`.
8. Test your new theme by asking Copilot a question and watching the thinking phrases.

**Screen reader tip:** Copilot Chat responses can be long. Use `Alt+F2` (Accessible View) to read them in a plain text buffer where you can copy text more easily.

**You are done when:** Your personalized thinking phrases appear when Copilot is processing a response.

### Completing Chapter 13: Submit Your Evidence

Open your **assigned Chapter 13 challenge issue** and post a completion comment:

```text
Chapter 13 completed:
- Copilot installed and signed in: yes / no
- Asked Copilot to explain a setting: yes / no
- Applied a setting from Copilot's suggestion: yes / no
- Created a custom theme: yes / no
- My theme universe: [your choice]
```

Close your Chapter 13 challenge issues when done.

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can install and authenticate GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Student can ask Copilot effective questions about code and settings.
- Student can use Copilot's output to customize their development environment.
- Student understands Copilot as a tool to explain and create, not just autocomplete.

### If You Get Stuck

1. Extension installation fails? Reload VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then `Developer: Reload Window`.
2. OAuth sign-in fails? Verify your GitHub account is active in the browser first, close VS Code and retry.
3. Chat panel does not open? Try `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`). If still nothing, check that the Copilot Chat extension is installed (not just the base Copilot extension).
4. Copilot seems unresponsive? Click the model selector at the bottom of Chat panel and confirm you are signed in.
5. Cannot copy from Copilot response? Use `Alt+F2` (Accessible View) to get the text in a copyable buffer.
6. Ask facilitator to verify Copilot is activated and show you one example prompt.

> **Continue learning:** The GitHub Skills courses [Getting Started with GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/skills/getting-started-with-github-copilot) and [Customize Your GitHub Copilot Experience](https://github.com/skills/customize-copilot) cover Copilot setup, prompting, and personalization. See [Appendix Z](appendix-z-github-skills-catalog.md) for the full catalog.

### Learning Moment

AI assistance amplifies clarity. Using Copilot as a brainstorming partner helps you write documentation that others can actually understand. The prompting skill you practiced here - asking specific questions, iterating on responses, applying results - transfers to every AI tool you will use in your career.

### Learning Pattern Used in This Chapter

1. Install the tool and verify it works before starting the task.
2. Use the tool to explore and understand (ask questions, read responses).
3. Use the tool to create something new (generate, customize, apply).
4. Reflect on when the tool helped and when your own judgment was better.

### About Learning Cards in This Chapter

Throughout this chapter, look for expandable "learning cards" that show how to accomplish each task from different perspectives. Not every section has every card - only the cards that add meaningful guidance for that topic are included.

| Card | Who it helps |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Visual / mouse | Sighted users who primarily use a mouse or trackpad |
| Low vision | Users who zoom to 200%+, use high contrast, or increase font sizes |
| NVDA / JAWS (Windows) | Screen reader users on Windows |
| VoiceOver (macOS) | Screen reader users on Mac |
| CLI | Users who prefer the terminal with `gh copilot` commands |

## 1. What is GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that suggests code and text completions as you type. It can:

- Complete lines of code or documentation
- Generate entire functions or sections of text from comments
- Answer questions about code in your workspace
- Explain complex code in plain language
- Draft documentation, issue responses, and commit messages
- Search for files and symbols across your workspace

**For this workshop:** Copilot helps with Markdown documentation, issue triage, PR descriptions, and commit messages - not just code.

**Copilot Free tier:** Available for all GitHub users. Provides access to inline suggestions and Copilot Chat with usage limits. No payment required for this workshop.

**Screen reader support:** Copilot is fully accessible with screen readers. Suggestions are announced via ARIA live regions, and Accessible View provides complete access to Chat responses.

> **Screen reader optimized mode:** Press `Shift+Alt+F1` (Mac: `Shift+Option+F1`) to toggle VS Code's screen reader optimized mode. This adjusts how Copilot suggestions are announced, disables ghost text that cannot be read by screen readers, and routes all suggestion content through Accessible View. If your screen reader is detected at startup, VS Code enables this mode automatically. You can also set it manually in Settings: `editor.accessibilitySupport: "on"`.


## 2. Installing GitHub Copilot

### Installation Steps

1. Open Extensions sidebar: `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+X`)
2. Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat"
3. Find **GitHub Copilot Chat** (publisher: GitHub)
4. Press `Enter` to open the extension detail page
5. `Tab` to "Install" button → press `Enter`
6. Wait for installation to complete

**One extension, all features:** GitHub Copilot Chat is now the single all-in-one extension. It provides inline code suggestions, the Chat panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`), inline chat (`Ctrl+I` / Mac: `Cmd+I`), and all agent features. The older separate "GitHub Copilot" extension has been deprecated.

### Signing In

After installation:

1. VS Code prompts: "Sign in to use GitHub Copilot"
2. Navigate to the notification or click the Copilot icon in the status bar
3. Select "Sign in to GitHub"
4. Your browser opens for GitHub authentication
5. Authorize the Copilot extension
6. Return to VS Code

#### Verify activation

- Bottom-right status bar shows Copilot icon (looks like `><`)
- Icon should be active (not grayed out)
- If grayed out, click it to sign in

### Checking Subscription Status

#### Command Palette

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Copilot: Check Status"
3. Select it to see your subscription tier (Free, Pro, Enterprise)

#### Free tier includes

- Completions and multi-line suggestions
- Copilot Chat
- Limited monthly usage (usually sufficient for documentation work)


## 3. Inline Suggestions - Ghost Text Completions

Copilot suggests completions as you type, displayed as gray "ghost text" after your cursor. In screen reader mode, VS Code announces suggestions rather than showing them visually.

### How Inline Suggestions Work

#### While typing

1. Copilot analyzes your context (file content, cursor position, nearby files)
2. Generates a suggestion
3. Presents the suggestion

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

The suggestion appears as **gray "ghost text"** after your cursor - a preview of what Copilot thinks you want to type next. It's there but not inserted; press `Tab` to accept it or `Escape` to dismiss.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Low vision users (zoom, high contrast, enlarged fonts)</summary>

Ghost text is intentionally low-contrast (gray on white). At high zoom levels this can be nearly invisible.

- **Increase ghost text contrast:** Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`), search `editorGhostText`, then customize `editor.ghostText.foreground` in your color theme to a darker shade such as `#555555`.
- **Use Accessible View instead:** Press `Alt+F2` when a suggestion appears. The suggestion text renders at your configured font size in a separate pane, making it far easier to read at 200%+ zoom.
- **Word-by-word acceptance** (`Ctrl+Right Arrow`) lets you watch each word appear at full contrast before deciding whether to continue.
- **High Contrast themes** do not automatically restyle ghost text. The color customization above is the most reliable fix.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver)</summary>

Suggestions are **announced via ARIA live regions** - ghost text is not visually meaningful to you so VS Code reads it instead:

- **NVDA/JAWS:** "Suggestion available" (or reads the suggestion text, depending on verbosity settings)
- **VoiceOver:** Announces suggestions in accessible form

Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`) to open the suggestion in **Accessible View** - this gives you the complete suggestion text in a static, fully readable panel without streaming.

</details>

### Accepting Suggestions

| Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
| --------  | ---------------  | -----  |
| Accept entire suggestion | `Tab` | `Tab` |
| Reject suggestion | `Escape` | `Escape` |
| Accept one word at a time | `Ctrl+Right Arrow` | `Cmd+Right Arrow` |
| Show next alternative suggestion | `Alt+]` | `Option+]` |
| Show previous alternative suggestion | `Alt+[` | `Option+[` |
| Open full suggestion list | `Ctrl+Enter` | `Cmd+Enter` |
| Open suggestion in Accessible View | `Alt+F2` | `Option+F2` |
| Insert suggestion from Accessible View at cursor | `Ctrl+/` | `Cmd+/` |

#### Accepting word-by-word (`Ctrl+Right Arrow` / Mac: `Cmd+Right Arrow`) is particularly useful when

- The suggestion starts correctly but you want to finish differently
- You want to review the suggestion incrementally
- You're learning and want to see how Copilot structures responses

### Reading Suggestions with Screen Readers

> **Visual users:** If Copilot's ghost text is getting in the way, skip to "Disabling Inline Suggestions" below.

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users - tuning announcement verbosity</summary>

#### If suggestions are announced too frequently or are intrusive

#### NVDA

1. NVDA Menu → Preferences → Settings → Presentation
2. Find "Report dynamic content changes"
3. Reduce verbosity level or set specific delays

#### JAWS

1. Settings Center → HTML/PDF/Accessibility
2. Adjust "Auto Forms Mode" and "ARIA Live Region" settings

#### VoiceOver

1. VoiceOver Utility → Verbosity
2. Reduce "Announcements" level

#### Alternative: Use Accessible View

Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`) when a suggestion appears to read it in the Accessible View (full text, no streaming).

</details>

### Prompting Through Comments

Copilot reads inline comments as instructions. For Markdown files:

```markdown
<!-- Write a step-by-step guide for screen reader users on how to create a GitHub issue -->
```

Type this comment, press `Enter`, and Copilot drafts content based on your instruction. You review, edit, and refine.

#### Example prompts for this workshop

```markdown
<!-- Explain how to navigate the GitHub Issues list with NVDA -->

<!-- Create a checklist for accessible Markdown documentation -->

<!-- Write alt text for a screenshot showing the GitHub PR review interface -->

<!-- Draft a commit message for fixing heading hierarchy in GUIDE.md -->
```

### Disabling Inline Suggestions

If suggestions are distracting:

<details>
<summary>Visual / mouse users</summary>

#### Temporarily disable for current language

- Click the Copilot icon in the status bar (bottom-right `><` icon)
- Select "Disable Completions for [language]"

#### Permanently disable completions

- Open Settings: `Ctrl+,` (Mac: `Cmd+,`) → search "Copilot enable" → uncheck "Enable Inline Suggestions"

</details>

<details>
<summary>Low vision users</summary>

The Copilot status bar icon (`><`) can be tiny at standard DPI. Use the Command Palette approach instead:

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Copilot: Toggle Completions" → press `Enter`
- This toggles inline suggestions on/off without needing to find a small icon.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Screen reader users (NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver)</summary>

#### Temporarily disable via Command Palette

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`) → type "Copilot: Disable Completions" → press `Enter`
- Or navigate to the Copilot status bar item and activate it (depends on screen reader and focus)

#### Permanently disable via Settings

- `Ctrl+,` (Mac: `Cmd+,`) → search "inline suggestions" → toggle off "GitHub Copilot: Enable Inline Completions"

</details>


## 4. GitHub Copilot Chat - Conversational Assistance

Copilot Chat is a full conversation interface where you ask questions, request explanations, and have content drafted.

### Opening Copilot Chat

**Primary panel:** `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`)

Opens the Chat panel on the right side of VS Code.

**Inline chat (in-file):** `Ctrl+I` (Mac: `Cmd+I`)

Opens a chat prompt directly in the editor, anchored to your cursor. Results appear inline. Best for file-specific edits.

**Quick Chat (floating):** `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+I` (macOS)

Opens a floating chat dialog that doesn't take up sidebar space.

<details>
<summary>Low vision users (zoom, high contrast, enlarged fonts)</summary>

At 200%+ zoom the Chat sidebar can squeeze the editor to a narrow column.

- **Use Quick Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I`) instead of the panel - it floats over the editor and closes when you press `Escape`, so you keep your full editor width.
- **Resize the Chat panel** by dragging its left edge or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and running `View: Reset Panel Size`.
- **Increase Chat font size:** Settings (`Ctrl+,`), search `chat.editor.fontSize`, and set it to match your editor font size.
- **Mode and model selectors:** At high zoom the bottom toolbar may wrap to two lines. Tab through the controls - the mode dropdown and model picker are always present even if visually cut off.

</details>

<details>
<summary>CLI users (gh copilot)</summary>

If you prefer the terminal, `gh copilot` lets you ask Copilot questions without opening VS Code Chat at all.

**Install the extension (one time):**

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-copilot
```

**Ask a general question:**

```bash
gh copilot suggest "How do I squash the last 3 commits?"
```

Copilot responds with a suggested command you can copy and run.

**Explain a command you don't recognize:**

```bash
gh copilot explain "git rebase -i HEAD~3"
```

Copilot returns a plain-language explanation.

**When to use CLI vs Chat:** Use `gh copilot` when you are already in a terminal session and want a quick answer without switching windows. Use VS Code Chat when you need workspace context (`@workspace`), file references, or multi-turn conversations.

</details>

### Chat Modes

Copilot Chat has four modes, selected from a dropdown at the bottom of the Chat input area. Each mode changes how Copilot interprets your request and what it can do.

| Mode | How It Works | Best For |
| ------  | -------------  | ----------  |
| **Ask** (default) | Conversational Q&A - Copilot explains, suggests, and answers but does not edit files directly | Questions, explanations, understanding unfamiliar code, reviewing content |
| **Edit** | You define a "working set" of files; Copilot proposes edits and shows a diff you approve or reject - nothing changes without your confirmation | Targeted, multi-file changes where you want full control |
| **Agent** | Copilot works autonomously - it decides which files to open, reads and writes code, and runs terminal commands to complete the task | Larger tasks where you want Copilot to drive end-to-end |
| **Plan** | Copilot produces a step-by-step implementation plan before writing any code; you review and approve the plan first | Complex features where you want to validate the approach before any changes are made |

#### Switching modes

- The mode selector is a dropdown at the **bottom of the Chat input area**, just above the text field
- Tab through the toolbar at the bottom of Chat to find it, or click on the current mode name
- Screen reader users: the mode name is announced when you focus that control; press `Space` or `Enter` to open the dropdown, then `Arrow` keys to choose

**Recommended mode for beginners:** Start with **Ask** to learn how Copilot responds to your questions, then explore **Edit** mode for making changes with full visibility into what Copilot touches. **Agent** mode is powerful but works best once you're comfortable reviewing its output.

> **Note:** **Plan** mode was introduced in October 2025 (VS Code 1.106) and is available as a public preview. Plan mode lets you get an AI-generated implementation plan before any code is written - useful for understanding what a complex change will involve.

### Choosing a Model

Copilot gives you access to AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), xAI (Grok), and others. The **model picker** is a button at the bottom of the Chat input area, next to the mode selector, showing the current model name (e.g., "Auto" or "Claude Sonnet 4.6").

**When "Auto" is selected** (the default), Copilot automatically chooses the best model for each request - lighter models for quick questions, more capable models for complex reasoning. Auto mode has been generally available since December 2025. You can override it whenever you want a specific model.

#### Quick guidance

- **Free-tier users:** GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 mini are available at no cost and handle most everyday tasks well
- **Need deep reasoning/debugging?** Try Claude Sonnet 4.6 or GPT-5.2 (1× premium requests)
- **Running Agent mode?** GPT-5.1-Codex-Max or GPT-5.2-Codex are optimized for autonomous tasks
- **High cost to avoid unless needed:** Claude Opus 4.6 (3× cost) - powerful but reserve for the most demanding work

For the complete model comparison, strengths, weaknesses, and plan availability, see [Appendix X: GitHub Copilot AI Models Reference](appendix-x-copilot-models.md).

<details>
<summary>Low vision users - finding the mode and model controls</summary>

Both the **mode selector** and **model picker** sit in the toolbar at the bottom of the Chat input area. At 200%+ zoom they may be cropped or wrapped.

- **Keyboard access:** From the Chat input field, press `Tab` repeatedly to move through the toolbar controls. Each control announces its current value (for example, "Ask" for the mode or "Auto" for the model).
- **Opening the dropdown:** Press `Space` or `Enter` on the control, then use `Arrow` keys to browse options. Press `Enter` to select.
- **If the controls are visually hidden at high zoom:** They are still in the Tab order. Keep pressing `Tab` past the Send button and you will reach them.
- **Alternative:** Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "Copilot: Select Model" or "Copilot: Change Chat Mode" to access these controls without finding them visually.

</details>

### What to Ask Copilot Chat

#### For this workshop (non-coding examples)

| Goal | Example Prompt |
| ------  | ----------------  |
| Understand a file | `Explain what @05-vscode-accessibility.md covers in plain language` |
| Improve documentation | `This section is unclear. Rewrite it for a first-time contributor using a screen reader: [paste text]` |
| Check tone | `Review this PR description for tone. Is it clear, respectful, and helpful? Suggest improvements.` |
| Draft content | `Write a section on keyboard navigation in VS Code for screen reader users` |
| Explain an error | `I got this error when trying to commit: [paste error]. What does it mean and how do I fix it?` |
| Generate alt text | `Write alt text for this image: [describe what's in the image]` |
| Create checklist | `Create an accessibility review checklist for Markdown documentation` |
| Review for accessibility | `Check this Markdown for accessibility issues: [paste content]` |

### Using @ Mentions in Chat

#### @ symbols let you provide context to Copilot

| Mention | What It Does |
| ---------  | -------------  |
| `@workspace` | Searches your entire workspace for context |
| `@filename.md` | References a specific file |
| `#file` | Lists files to select from |
| `#selection` | References your currently selected text |
| `#terminalLastCommand` | References the last terminal command and output |

#### Example prompts with context

```text
Explain what @README.md covers for a new contributor

Review #selection for accessibility issues

Search @workspace for all references to "screen reader mode"

What does this error mean? #terminalLastCommand
```

### Using Slash Commands

Type `/` in Copilot Chat to see available commands:

| Command | What It Does |
| ---------  | -------------  |
| `/explain` | Explains selected code or text |
| `/fix` | Suggests fixes for problems in selected code |
| `/tests` | Generates tests (for code files) |
| `/help` | Shows all available commands |
| `/clear` | Clears chat history |
| `/savePrompt` | Saves the current chat conversation as a reusable `.prompt.md` file |

#### Example

1. Select a block of complex Markdown
2. Open Chat: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`)
3. Type `/explain`
4. Copilot explains the structure and purpose

### Built-in Actions via Command Palette

Copilot registers actions directly in the Command Palette. This provides a discoverable way to use Copilot without remembering slash commands or keyboard shortcuts.

1. Open Command Palette: `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type `copilot`
3. Browse the list of available actions

Useful built-in actions include:

| Action | What It Does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Copilot: Explain This | Explains the selected code or text |
| Copilot: Generate Docs | Generates documentation for the selected code |
| Copilot: Generate Tests | Creates test cases for the selected code |
| Copilot: Fix This | Suggests a fix for the selected code |
| Copilot: Review and Comment | Reviews selected code and adds comments |

> **Screen reader tip:** After pressing `F1` and typing `copilot`, use `Down Arrow` to browse the filtered list. Your screen reader announces each action name. Press `Enter` to run the selected action on your current selection.


## 5. Effective Prompting for Documentation Work

Copilot works best with clear, specific prompts. The more context you provide, the better the response.

### Anatomy of a Good Prompt

#### Bad prompt

```text
Write about accessibility
```

#### Good prompt

```text
Write a 3-paragraph section explaining how screen reader users can navigate the VS Code Explorer sidebar. Include keyboard shortcuts for NVDA and JAWS. Assume the reader has never used VS Code before. Use clear headings and bullet points.
```

#### What makes it good

1. **Specific scope:** "3-paragraph section"
2. **Clear topic:** "navigate the VS Code Explorer sidebar"
3. **Target audience:** "screen reader users" who "never used VS Code"
4. **Required details:** "keyboard shortcuts for NVDA and JAWS"
5. **Format guidance:** "headings and bullet points"

### Prompting Patterns for This Workshop

#### Pattern 1: Contextual Rewrite

```text
This section is too technical for beginners. Rewrite it in plain language:

[paste existing text]

Target audience: Screen reader users trying VS Code for the first time
```

#### Pattern 2: Generate with Constraints

```text
Write a step-by-step guide for creating a GitHub issue using only keyboard navigation. Include:
- NVDA screen reader announcements
- Exact keyboard shortcuts
- What to do if the form field is not announced correctly
Format as a numbered list
```

#### Pattern 3: Review and Improve

```text
Review this PR description for:
1. Clarity for maintainers
2. Respect and positive tone
3. Whether it links to the related issue
4. If it explains WHY the change matters

Here's the description:
[paste your PR description]
```

#### Pattern 4: Accessibility Audit

```text
Check this Markdown for accessibility problems:
- Heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3, no skips)
- Link text (no "click here" or bare URLs)
- Alt text for images
- List structure

[paste Markdown content]
```

#### Pattern 5: Draft from Outline

```text
Write a section based on this outline:

## Timeline View - File History
- What Timeline shows
- How to open it (keyboard)
- How screen readers announce each commit
- How to view a specific commit's changes

Write for screen reader users. Use H3 subheadings. Include a table for keyboard shortcuts.
```

### Iterating on Responses

Copilot's first response is a draft. Refine it:

#### Follow-up prompts

```text
Make it shorter - reduce to 5 bullet points

Add more detail about what NVDA announces at each step

Rewrite this in a more friendly tone

Add a "Common Mistakes" section at the end

Format this as a table instead of a bulleted list
```

Copilot remembers the conversation context - just say what to change.


## 6. Custom Instructions vs Custom Agents

Two distinct tools shape how Copilot behaves. Understanding the difference is critical for working with Accessibility Agents (see [Chapter 16: Accessibility Agents](16-accessibility-agents.md)).

### Custom Instructions

**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Purpose:** Always-on background guidance for every Copilot interaction.

#### What they do

- Apply to all code suggestions automatically
- Set project-wide standards
- Influence tone and style
- Provide context about your project's conventions

#### Example `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

```markdown
# Copilot Instructions for accessibility-agents

## Accessibility Standards
- Include semantic HTML elements in generated markup
- Add ARIA labels to interactive components when no visible text is present
- Ensure keyboard navigation patterns are implemented for custom widgets

## Documentation Style
- Write for screen reader users first
- Include keyboard shortcuts for NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- Use active voice and imperative mood ("Press Ctrl+G" not "You can press Ctrl+G")
- Structure content with clear headings (H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)

## Commit Message Format
- Follow conventional commits: `type: description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123"

## Tone
- Friendly but professional
- Direct and actionable
- Assume readers are competent but may be new to this specific tool
```

**When active:** Every time Copilot generates a suggestion (inline or in Chat)

### You never have to ask for these - Copilot simply follows them

### Custom Agents

**Files:** `.github/agents/[name].agent.md`

**Purpose:** On-demand, focused workflows that you deliberately invoke.

#### What they do

- Perform specific, repeatable tasks
- Can access specific tools (GitHub API, file system, terminal)
- Generate structured output (reports, reviews, analysis)
- Execute multi-step workflows

#### Example agent names

- `@daily-briefing` - Summarize repository activity
- `@issue-tracker` - Find and prioritize issues
- `@pr-review` - Generate PR review documentation
- `@analytics` - Team contribution metrics
- `@insiders-a11y-tracker` - Monitor accessibility changes

**When active:** Only when you type `@agent-name` in Copilot Chat

See [Chapter 16: Accessibility Agents](16-accessibility-agents.md) for complete agent documentation.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Custom Instructions | Custom Agent |
| ---  | ---  | ---  |
| **When active** | Background - every interaction | On-demand - you type `@agent-name` |
| **Defined in** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/agents/[name].agent.md` |
| **Tool access** | Standard Copilot tools | Can restrict or grant specific permissions |
| **Best for** | Broad coding standards and preferences | Focused, repeatable, specialized tasks |
| **Requires invocation** | No - always on | Yes - explicit trigger |

### Using Both Together

**Custom instructions** ensure Copilot follows your accessibility standards on every suggestion.

**Custom agents** handle specific workflows like auditing, issue tracking, or automated remediation.

#### Example workflow

1. Your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` says: "Always check heading hierarchy in Markdown"
2. You invoke `@insiders-a11y-tracker` to scan recent changes
3. The agent finds a heading skip (H1 → H3)
4. You ask Copilot Chat to fix it: "Fix the heading hierarchy in this file"
5. Copilot's fix follows your custom instructions (uses semantic HTML, adds ARIA where needed)

#### Both work together - instructions guide every response, agents automate specific workflows


### Writing Accessibility-Focused Custom Instructions

> Source: [accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/copilot-instructions/](https://accessibility.github.com/documentation/guide/copilot-instructions/)

Custom instructions can be set at three levels. Each level cascades to narrower scopes:

| Level | Where | Effect |
| -------  | -------  | --------  |
| **Organization** | Copilot organization settings | Applies to all repositories in the org |
| **Repository** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Overrides org instructions; applies to one repo |
| **Personal** | GitHub.com → Settings → Copilot → Instructions | Your own preferences; highest priority |

#### Do's - What Makes Instructions Effective

##### Use normative language: MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT

Most language models respond well to normative language. These terms reduce ambiguity and make rules clearly mandatory versus optional - the same approach WCAG itself uses:

```text
## Keyboard Navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts SHOULD NOT override high-priority browser or OS shortcuts.
- A keyboard shortcut MUST use at most 4 simultaneous keys.
- All interactive components MUST be reachable by Tab key.
```

### Focus on team-specific standards, not generic principles

Copilot already knows WCAG. Tell it what *your team* does specifically:

```text
This application MUST conform to WCAG 2.2 Level AA.
DeprecatedButton SHOULD NOT be used; use NewAccessibleButton instead.
```

### Use lists and checklists to structure instructions

Lists provide clear guardrails - Copilot follows them step by step:

```text
## Checklist for evaluating 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
- [ ] role="presentation" MUST NOT be applied to semantic elements.
- [ ] Error messages MUST be programmatically associated with inputs.
- [ ] Name-value pairs MUST NOT use headings; use <p>.
```

### Reference and enforce your design system

Document which components to use and which are deprecated. Design systems evolve - keep instructions current:

```text
Use AccessibleModal from @company/ui-kit@3.x.
LegacyDialog MUST NOT be used in any new code.
```

#### Don'ts - Common Instruction Mistakes

##### Don't paste entire WCAG guidelines

Copilot is already trained on WCAG. Pasting the full text wastes context space and dilutes your specific instructions. Instead, write concise, actionable rules that give *net-new* information: your team's specific practices, exceptions, and priorities.

##### Don't reference external links

By default, Copilot does not access external links in custom instructions - this is a deliberate security feature. A URL like `https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/` will not be fetched. Write the relevant rule directly.

##### Don't reference private repositories

Copilot cannot access private repository content from within custom instructions unless the content is already present in the active repo.

#### Additional Guidance

**Role-based prompting** - You can give Copilot a persona to shape how it responds:

```text
As the lead accessibility expert on your team, your primary focus is ensuring
all UI is accessible by default, relying on semantic HTML before ARIA attributes.
```

Be specific about skills and responsibilities; avoid broad personas that may introduce unintended assumptions.

**Keep instructions concise.** There is no hard character limit, but overly long instructions reduce precision. Summarize the most important, actionable rules rather than listing every possible guideline.

**Contribute effective instructions** to [github.com/github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) so others benefit from your organization's work.

- **Markdown Accessibility Review Guidelines** - A practical guide for reviewing Markdown output for accessibility, useful as a reference when writing documentation-focused instructions: [Markdown Accessibility](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/markdown-accessibility.md)


## 7. Using Accessible View with Copilot Responses

Copilot Chat responses stream in token by token. This is visually nice but can fragment screen reader announcements. **Accessible View** provides complete, structured access to generated content.

> **Not just for screen readers:** Accessible View is also valuable for low vision users. It renders text at your configured editor font size in a clean pane without the Chat panel's smaller default font, cramped layout, or streaming animation.

### Why Use Accessible View for Copilot

#### Without Accessible View

- Responses announced in fragments as tokens arrive
- Live region updates may interrupt or overlap
- Difficult to re-read specific parts
- Context can be lost in streaming

#### With Accessible View (`Alt+F2` / Mac: `Option+F2`)

- Full complete response in a readable pane
- Navigate with `Up/Down Arrow` at your own pace
- Code blocks properly formatted
- Headings and lists structured
- No interruptions or live region noise

### Recommended Workflow

#### Every time you ask Copilot something

1. Type your prompt in Chat input
2. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (Mac: `Cmd+Enter`) to send
3. Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`) to open Accessible View - you can open it immediately after sending, before the response finishes
4. Follow along as the response streams in the Accessible View in real-time
5. Read or re-read any section with `Arrow` keys
6. Press `Escape` to close Accessible View and return to Chat

> **VS Code December 2025 update:** The Accessible View now updates dynamically as responses stream in. You no longer need to wait for a response to finish before opening it - open `Alt+F2` right after sending and follow the response as it arrives.

#### Benefits

- Follow responses live without waiting
- Navigate and re-read at your own pace
- Code blocks and lists are properly structured
- Headings are announced correctly

### Accessible View for Inline Suggestions

#### When a suggestion appears

1. Don't accept it immediately
2. Press `Alt+F2` (Mac: `Option+F2`)
3. Accessible View shows: "Suggestion: [full text of the suggestion]"
4. Read it completely
5. To insert the suggestion at your cursor: press `Ctrl+/` (Mac: `Cmd+/`)
6. To close without inserting: press `Escape`, then `Tab` to accept or `Escape` to reject

**`Ctrl+/` (Mac: `Cmd+/`) inserts the suggestion directly from Accessible View** - you don’t need to close the view first and then press `Tab`. This is the recommended workflow for screen reader users.

#### This is especially useful for multi-line suggestions where the ghost text is hard to review

### Code Blocks in Accessible View

When Copilot suggests code or Markdown:

#### In Accessible View

- Code blocks are in `<pre>` elements
- Screen readers announce "code block" or "pre-formatted text"
- Each line is on its own line (not run together)
- Indentation is preserved

**NVDA/JAWS:** Use `Arrow` keys to read line by line. Use `Ctrl+Home` to jump to the start.

**VoiceOver:** Interact with the code block (`VO+Shift+Down`) to read each line with proper structure.


## 8. Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

### Copilot Inline Suggestions

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
| --------  | ---------------  | -------  |
| Accept suggestion | `Tab` | `Tab` |
| Reject suggestion | `Escape` | `Escape` |
| Accept word-by-word | `Ctrl+Right Arrow` | `Cmd+Right Arrow` |
| Next suggestion | `Alt+]` | `Option+]` |
| Previous suggestion | `Alt+[` | `Option+[` |
| Open suggestions list | `Ctrl+Enter` | `Cmd+Enter` |
| Open suggestion in Accessible View | `Alt+F2` | `Option+F2` |
| Insert suggestion from Accessible View | `Ctrl+/` | `Cmd+/` |

### Copilot Chat

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
| --------  | ---------------  | -------  |
| Open Chat panel | `Ctrl+Shift+I` | `Cmd+Shift+I` |
| Inline chat (in-file) | `Ctrl+I` | `Cmd+I` |
| Quick chat (floating) | `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I` | `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+I` |
| Send message | `Ctrl+Enter` | `Cmd+Enter` |
| Clear chat | `Ctrl+L` | `Cmd+L` |

### Accessibility

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
| --------  | ---------------  | -------  |
| Toggle screen reader optimized mode | `Shift+Alt+F1` | `Shift+Option+F1` |
| Open Accessible View | `Alt+F2` | `Option+F2` |
| Open Accessible Help | `Alt+H` | `Option+H` |
| Close Accessible View | `Escape` | `Escape` |

### VS Code General (Quick Reference)

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
| --------  | ---------------  | -------  |
| Command Palette | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | `Cmd+Shift+P` |
| Go to file | `Ctrl+P` | `Cmd+P` |
| Find in file | `Ctrl+F` | `Cmd+F` |
| Settings | `Ctrl+,` | `Cmd+,` |
| Source Control | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | `Cmd+Shift+G` |
| Explorer | `Ctrl+Shift+E` | `Cmd+Shift+E` |
| Terminal | `Ctrl+Backtick` | `Ctrl+Backtick` |

### GitHub.com Shortcuts (Not VS Code)

These shortcuts work on GitHub.com in your browser, not inside VS Code. Students sometimes confuse them with Copilot shortcuts because they involve similar key combinations.

| Action | Shortcut | What it opens |
| ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| Open github.dev web editor | `.` (period key) | A lightweight VS Code editor in your browser tab. Read-only for most operations. Copilot is **not** available here. |
| Open in a Codespace | `,` (comma key) | A full cloud development environment with a terminal. Copilot **is** available if your account has access. |

> **Ctrl+. versus the period key:** On a GitHub repository page, pressing the `.` (period) key alone opens github.dev. This is different from `Ctrl+.` inside VS Code, which opens the Quick Fix menu. If you press `Ctrl+.` on GitHub.com, it opens the GitHub Command Palette, not github.dev. These three actions share similar keys but do completely different things depending on where you press them.

> **Screen reader note:** When github.dev opens, your browser tab reloads into a VS Code-like interface. Your screen reader may announce "Visual Studio Code" or "GitHub Dev Editor." This is a web page, not the desktop application. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to confirm you are in github.dev by reading the title bar.

**Complete keyboard reference:** See [Appendix M: VS Code Accessibility Reference](appendix-m-vscode-accessibility-reference.md)

### Video Tutorials (Screen Reader Demonstrations)

GitHub's accessibility team has published screen reader walkthroughs for each major Copilot feature:

- [Inline suggestions with a screen reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaqemiAR1yk) - accepting, rejecting, and reviewing ghost text suggestions with NVDA
- [Inline chat with a screen reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJfiVSaq7HA) - using `Ctrl+I` to edit code in place with screen reader feedback
- [Chat view with a screen reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pGMzWqFnSQ) - navigating the Chat panel, reading responses, and using Accessible View
- [Built-in actions with a screen reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalGp3kMPKY) - running Copilot commands from the Command Palette

> **Tip:** These videos show NVDA with VS Code on Windows. The workflows apply to JAWS and VoiceOver with minor shortcut differences noted in each section above.


## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Not Suggesting Anything

**Issue:** No suggestions appear as you type.

#### Solutions

1. Check Copilot is active: status bar icon should not be grayed out
2. Click the Copilot icon → verify "Completions enabled"
3. Check subscription status: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copilot: Check Status"
4. Restart VS Code
5. Sign out and sign back in: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copilot: Sign Out"

### Suggestions Are Too Frequent/Distracting

**Issue:** Constant interruptions from suggestions.

#### Solutions

1. Use word-by-word acceptance: `Ctrl+Right Arrow`
2. Reduce screen reader verbosity (see Section 3)
3. Use Accessible View (`Alt+F2`) to review suggestions without live announcements
4. Disable inline suggestions temporarily: Copilot icon → "Disable Completions"

### Chat Responses Not Announced

**Issue:** Screen reader silent when Copilot responds.

#### Solutions

1. Wait for response to complete, then press `Alt+F2` for Accessible View
2. Check ARIA live region settings in your screen reader
3. Navigate manually to the response area with `Tab` or `Arrow` keys
4. Use Quick Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I`) instead of panel chat

### "Copilot Subscription Required"

**Issue:** Extension installed but asks for subscription.

#### Solutions

1. Sign in to GitHub: Copilot icon → "Sign in"
2. Verify GitHub account has Copilot access (free tier or paid)
3. Check [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot) for subscription status
4. Free tier users: ensure you haven't exceeded monthly limits


## Try It: Your First Copilot Conversation

**Time:** 3 minutes | **What you need:** VS Code with Copilot Chat extension installed

1. **Open Copilot Chat** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+I`). Your screen reader announces the chat panel.
2. **Ask a question** - Type: `What does the CONTRIBUTING.md file in this repository say about how to submit a pull request?` Press `Enter`.
3. **Read the response** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to open the Accessible View if your screen reader doesn't read the response automatically. The response appears as plain text you can arrow through.
4. **Try a follow-up** - Type: `Summarize that in 3 bullet points` and press `Enter`. Copilot remembers the context from your first question.

**You're done.** You just had a conversation with an AI about your codebase.

> **What success feels like:** Copilot answered a real question about real files in your repository. You can use this same pattern to ask about code, documentation, or anything else in the project - and the Accessible View ensures you can always read the response.
