# Appendix AC: GitHub CLI Reference
>
> **Episode coming soon:** GitHub CLI Reference - a conversational audio overview of this appendix. Listen before reading to preview the concepts, or after to reinforce what you learned.

## Your Terminal, Supercharged for GitHub

> **Who this is for:** You want to manage GitHub — issues, pull requests, repos, releases — from your terminal without opening a browser. The GitHub CLI (`gh`) gives you full access to GitHub from the command line, with clean plain-text output that works beautifully with screen readers.
>
> `gh` handles the GitHub side of things (issues, PRs, repos, releases). `git` handles the local version control side (commits, branches, history). You use both together.

## 1. Installing and Authenticating

### Installing

#### Windows

```bash
winget install GitHub.cli
```

Or download the installer from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com).

#### macOS

```bash
brew install gh
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \
&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
&& wget -qO- https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install gh -y
```

#### Verify installation

```bash
gh --version
```

### Authenticating

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Where do you use GitHub?** → GitHub.com (or Enterprise)
- **Preferred protocol?** → HTTPS (or SSH)
- **Authenticate with browser?** → Yes — your browser opens for OAuth sign-in

After signing in, return to the terminal. You're done.

```bash
# Check your auth status at any time
gh auth status

# Log out
gh auth logout

# Refresh credentials / add new scopes
gh auth refresh
```

> **Screen reader tip:** `gh auth login` is an interactive prompt — navigate with `Arrow` keys, confirm with `Enter`. All prompts are plain text and read naturally. The browser step opens automatically; switch back to the terminal when the browser confirms success.

---

## 2. Repos — Clone, Fork, Create, View

```bash
# Clone a repository (automatically sets up the remote)
gh repo clone owner/repo-name

# Fork a repo and clone your fork in one step
gh repo fork owner/repo-name --clone

# Fork without cloning (creates the fork on GitHub only)
gh repo fork owner/repo-name

# Create a brand new repository
gh repo create my-new-project
gh repo create my-new-project --public --description "My project description"
gh repo create my-new-project --private

# View a repository's details
gh repo view
gh repo view owner/repo-name

# Open the repo in your browser
gh repo view --web

# List your repositories
gh repo list
gh repo list --limit 50

# List repos for an org
gh repo list my-org --limit 100

# Archive a repository
gh repo archive owner/repo-name

# Delete a repository (careful!)
gh repo delete owner/repo-name --confirm

# Sync your fork with upstream
gh repo sync
gh repo sync --branch main
```

---

## 3. Issues — Create, List, View, Comment, Close

### Creating issues

```bash
# Create an issue interactively (opens a prompt for title, body, labels, etc.)
gh issue create

# Create with all details inline
gh issue create \
  --title "Screen reader can't navigate the settings menu" \
  --body "When using NVDA with Firefox, the Settings menu items are not announced..." \
  --label "bug,accessibility" \
  --assignee "@me"

# Create from a Markdown file (great for detailed bug reports)
gh issue create --title "Accessibility audit findings" --body-file ./report.md
```

### Listing and filtering issues

```bash
# List open issues (current repo)
gh issue list

# List issues with filters
gh issue list --label "accessibility"
gh issue list --label "good first issue"
gh issue list --assignee "@me"
gh issue list --state closed
gh issue list --limit 50

# Search issues by keyword
gh issue list --search "screen reader"

# List issues across all repos you watch
gh issue list --repo owner/repo-name
```

### Viewing issues

```bash
# View an issue (renders Markdown as plain text in the terminal)
gh issue view 42

# Open the issue in your browser
gh issue view 42 --web

# View comments on an issue
gh issue view 42 --comments
```

> **Screen reader tip:** `gh issue view 42` outputs clean plain text — title, metadata, and body all formatted without noise. Read line by line with `Arrow` keys. Much faster than navigating a browser page with a screen reader.

### Commenting and updating

```bash
# Add a comment to an issue
gh issue comment 42 --body "I can reproduce this on Windows 11 with NVDA 2024.1."

# Comment from a file
gh issue comment 42 --body-file ./my-comment.md

# Edit an issue (title, body, labels, assignees)
gh issue edit 42 --title "Updated title"
gh issue edit 42 --add-label "needs-reproduction"
gh issue edit 42 --remove-label "bug"
gh issue edit 42 --add-assignee username

# Close an issue
gh issue close 42
gh issue close 42 --comment "Fixed in PR #56."
gh issue close 42 --reason "not planned"

# Reopen a closed issue
gh issue reopen 42
```

### Pinning and locking

```bash
# Pin an issue (shows at top of the Issues tab)
gh issue pin 42

# Lock an issue (prevents new comments)
gh issue lock 42 --reason "resolved"
```

---

## 4. Pull Requests — Create, Review, Merge, Check

### Creating a PR

```bash
# Create a PR interactively (prompts for title, body, base branch, etc.)
gh pr create

# Create with all details inline
gh pr create \
  --title "Add keyboard navigation to settings menu" \
  --body "Closes #42. Adds Tab/arrow key support to the settings dropdown." \
  --base main \
  --label "accessibility,enhancement"

# Create as a draft
gh pr create --draft

# Create from a file
gh pr create --title "Accessibility improvements" --body-file ./pr-description.md

# Open the PR creation form in your browser
gh pr create --web
```

### Listing and viewing PRs

```bash
# List open PRs
gh pr list

# List with filters
gh pr list --state closed
gh pr list --author "@me"
gh pr list --label "accessibility"
gh pr list --search "screen reader"

# View a PR (title, description, status, checks)
gh pr view 56

# View the diff of a PR
gh pr diff 56

# Open the PR in your browser
gh pr view 56 --web

# Check out a PR branch locally (to test it)
gh pr checkout 56
```

### Reviewing PRs

```bash
# Approve a PR
gh pr review 56 --approve
gh pr review 56 --approve --body "Tested with NVDA — keyboard nav works perfectly. LGTM!"

gh pr review 56 --request-changes --body "The focus indicator disappears on the last menu item."

# Leave a comment review (no approval/rejection)
gh pr review 56 --comment --body "A few observations — see inline comments."
```

### Checking CI status

```bash
# View all CI checks for a PR
gh pr checks 56

# Watch checks update in real time (refreshes every 10s)
gh pr checks 56 --watch

# View checks for the current branch
gh pr checks
```

### Merging PRs

```bash
# Merge a PR (interactive — prompts for merge strategy)
gh pr merge 56

# Merge with a specific strategy
gh pr merge 56 --merge          # Creates a merge commit
gh pr merge 56 --squash         # Squashes all commits into one
gh pr merge 56 --rebase         # Rebases commits onto base branch

# Auto-merge when checks pass (great for PRs waiting on CI)
gh pr merge 56 --auto --squash

# Delete the branch after merging
gh pr merge 56 --squash --delete-branch
```

### Other PR operations

```bash
# Convert a draft PR to ready for review
gh pr ready 56

# Mark a ready PR back as draft
gh pr ready 56 --undo

# Update your PR branch with the latest from base (equivalent to "Update branch" button)
gh pr update-branch 56
gh pr update-branch 56 --rebase

# Close a PR without merging
gh pr close 56
gh pr close 56 --comment "Superseded by #58."

# Reopen a closed PR
gh pr reopen 56

# Add a comment to a PR
gh pr comment 56 --body "Thanks for the thorough review! Addressing feedback now."
```

## 6. Search — Issues, PRs, Repos, Code

```bash
# Search issues across all of GitHub
gh search issues "screen reader navigation" --label accessibility
gh search issues "keyboard shortcut" --repo owner/repo-name
gh search issues "help wanted" --language javascript --limit 20

# Search pull requests
gh search prs "accessibility fix" --state open
gh search prs "WCAG" --author username

# Search repositories
gh search repos "accessible markdown editor" --language python --stars ">100"
gh search repos "screen reader" --topic accessibility

# Search code
gh search code "aria-label" --repo owner/repo-name
gh search code "git cherry-pick" --language markdown
```

---

## 7. Labels and Milestones

### Labels

```bash
# List labels in the current repo
gh label list

# Create a label
gh label create "accessibility" --color "0075ca" --description "Accessibility improvements"

# Clone labels from another repo (copies all their labels to yours)
gh label clone owner/source-repo

# Delete a label
gh label delete "wontfix"
```

### Milestones

```bash
# List milestones
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones --jq '.[].title'

# Create a milestone
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones \
  --method POST \
  --field title="v2.0 Launch" \
  --field description="All features for the v2.0 release" \
  --field due_on="2026-06-01T00:00:00Z"
```

---

## 8. Output Formatting — JSON, jq, Templates

By default `gh` outputs human-readable text. For scripting or custom display, you can get raw JSON and filter it.

### --json flag

```bash
# Get issue data as JSON
gh issue view 42 --json title,body,labels,state

# Get PR data as JSON
gh pr view 56 --json title,number,state,mergeable,reviews

# List issues as JSON
gh issue list --json number,title,labels,assignees
```

### --jq flag (filter JSON inline)

```bash
# List just issue numbers and titles
gh issue list --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'

# Get the names of all labels on an issue
gh issue view 42 --json labels --jq '.labels[].name'

# Count open PRs
gh pr list --json number --jq 'length'

# List reviewers who approved a PR
gh pr view 56 --json reviews --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.state=="APPROVED") | .author.login] | unique'
```

### --template flag (Go templates)

```bash
# Custom formatted output
gh issue list --template '{{range .}}#{{.number}} {{.title}} ({{.state}}){{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

> **Screen reader tip:** `--json` with `--jq` produces clean, predictable output — ideal for piping to a file or reading with a screen reader. The default human-readable output is also clean, but JSON gives you precise control over what's announced.

---

## 9. Aliases — Create Your Own Shortcuts

Aliases let you create custom `gh` commands from long commands you run often.

```bash
# Create an alias
gh alias set bugs 'issue list --label bug'
gh alias set my-prs 'pr list --author @me'
gh alias set review-ready 'pr list --label "ready for review"'

# Use your alias
gh bugs
gh my-prs
gh review-ready

# List all aliases
gh alias list

# Delete an alias
gh alias delete bugs

# Create a shell alias (runs a shell command, not just gh commands)
gh alias set --shell open-pr 'gh pr view $1 --web'
gh open-pr 56   # opens PR #56 in the browser
```

### Useful aliases to set up

```bash
# Issues assigned to you
gh alias set mine 'issue list --assignee @me'

# Your open PRs
gh alias set mypr 'pr list --author @me --state open'

# Check CI on current branch's PR
gh alias set ci 'pr checks'

# View current PR
gh alias set pr 'pr view'
```

---

## 10. Extensions — Adding New Commands

Extensions add new `gh` subcommands written by the community.

```bash
# Browse available extensions
gh extension search

# Install an extension
gh extension install owner/gh-extension-name

# List installed extensions
gh extension list

# Update all extensions
gh extension upgrade --all

# Update a specific extension
gh extension upgrade owner/gh-extension-name

# Remove an extension
gh extension remove owner/gh-extension-name
```

### Useful extensions

| Extension | What it does | Install |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `github/gh-copilot` | Ask Copilot questions in the terminal | `gh extension install github/gh-copilot` |
| `nicokosi/gh-notify` | Desktop notifications for GitHub events | `gh extension install nicokosi/gh-notify` |
| `mislav/gh-branch` | Better branch switching with fuzzy search | `gh extension install mislav/gh-branch` |

---

## 11. Copilot in the CLI

Install the Copilot extension once, then ask coding and git questions without leaving the terminal.

```bash
# Install (one time)
gh extension install github/gh-copilot

# Ask for a command suggestion
gh copilot suggest "squash my last 4 commits into one"
gh copilot suggest "find which commit introduced a bug in auth.js"
gh copilot suggest "create a pull request from my current branch"

# Explain a command you don't recognize
gh copilot explain "git rebase -i HEAD~3"
gh copilot explain "git bisect start"
gh copilot explain "find . -name '*.md' -mtime -7"
```

Copilot CLI shows the suggested command, explains what it does, and asks whether to run it — perfect for learning while doing.

> **See also:** [Appendix AA: Advanced Git Operations, Section 11](appendix-aa-advanced-git.md#11-using-github-copilot-for-git-operations) for more Copilot CLI examples with git operations.

## 12. Screen Reader Tips

The GitHub CLI is one of the most screen-reader-friendly ways to use GitHub. Here's why and how to get the most out of it.

### Why the CLI works so well

- **Plain text output** — no visual noise, no unlabelled buttons, no hidden dialogs
- **Predictable structure** — every command produces consistent output you can navigate with arrow keys
- **No focus traps** — you control when you read output; nothing streams unexpectedly
- **Keyboard-first by design** — everything is a command you type

### Tips by task

**Reading issues and PRs:**
```bash
# Pipe output to less for page-by-page reading
gh issue view 42 | less

# Save to a file and open in your editor
gh pr view 56 > pr-56.md
code pr-56.md
```

**Navigating long lists:**
```bash
# Limit results to a manageable number
gh issue list --limit 10

# Combine with search to narrow down
gh issue list --search "keyboard" --limit 5
```

**Getting just what you need:**
```bash
# Get just the PR title
gh pr view 56 --json title --jq '.title'

# Get just the issue body
gh issue view 42 --json body --jq '.body'

# Get CI check status as a simple list
gh pr checks 56 --json name,state --jq '.[] | "\(.state): \(.name)"'
```

**Creating content without a browser:**
```bash
# Write your issue body in a text file first (easier with a screen reader)
# Then create the issue from the file
gh issue create --title "Bug: focus lost after modal closes" --body-file ./issue.md
```

### NVDA / JAWS (Windows)

- Run `gh` commands in Windows Terminal or the VS Code integrated terminal — both work well with NVDA/JAWS
- Use `Insert+Down` (NVDA) or `Insert+F12` (JAWS) to read the current line of terminal output
- For long output, use `| less` and navigate with `Space` (next page) and `b` (back)

### VoiceOver (macOS)

- Run `gh` in Terminal.app or VS Code integrated terminal
- `VO+Right` moves through terminal output character by character; `VO+Down` line by line
- Use `Ctrl+C` to stop a running command if output is too long
