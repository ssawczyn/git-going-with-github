# Git Going with GitHub - Audio Series

## Episode 29: GitHub Security Features

**Series:** Git Going with GitHub
**Episode:** 29 of 44
**Audience:** Blind and low-vision developers learning GitHub and open source
**Estimated length:** 12-15 min

---

### Audio Production Direction

Generate a conversational two-host podcast episode about this topic.
The audience is blind and low-vision developers attending a two-day workshop on GitHub.

**Tone and style:**

- Welcoming and encouraging - many listeners are encountering these concepts for the first time
- Use spatial and structural descriptions, not visual references
- Say "navigate to" or "move to the section called" instead of "look for" or "you will see"
- Define technical terms on first use - do not assume familiarity with programming jargon
- Focus on deep conceptual understanding - explain WHY, not just HOW
- Share practical tips, common mistakes, and real-world context
- When describing keyboard shortcuts, say the full key names: "Control plus Shift plus P" not "Ctrl+Shift+P"
- Keep the conversation natural - two hosts discussing the topic, not reading a script
- Include at least one real-world analogy per major concept
- End with a brief summary of key takeaways and what comes next

**Episode focus:**

- Dependabot: automated dependency updates and security alerts
- Secret scanning: detecting leaked tokens and keys
- Code scanning with CodeQL
- Private security advisories
- How to respond when a vulnerability is detected

---

## 1. The Security Tab - What It Contains

Every GitHub repository has a **Security tab** in its navigation bar. What you see there depends on whether you are a contributor with elevated access or a public viewer.

**Public viewers see:**
- Security policy (if the repo has a `SECURITY.md`)
- The private vulnerability reporting form (if enabled by the maintainer)

**Contributors with write or admin access see:**
- Dependabot alerts
- Secret scanning alerts
- Code scanning alerts
- Security advisories
- The ability to manage security settings

### Screen Reader Path to the Security Tab

```
On any repository page:
Tab navigation → secondary nav region → "Security" link → Enter
Or: G then S (GitHub keyboard shortcut - enable Focus Mode first)
```

## 2. Dependabot - Automated Dependency Updates

Dependabot is GitHub's automated dependency monitoring and update system. It does two things:

### Dependabot Alerts

When a known security vulnerability (CVE - Common Vulnerability and Exposure) is discovered in a package your project depends on, GitHub creates a **Dependabot alert**.

**Alert severity levels:**

| Level | CVSS Score Range | What it means |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | Exploit likely, wide impact - fix immediately |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | Significant risk - fix this sprint |
| **Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | Some risk with specific conditions - schedule fix |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | Low likelihood of exploitation - fix when convenient |

**What a dependency alert looks like:**

```
Alert: Dependabot alert #5
Severity: High
Package: lodash (npm)
Vulnerable version: < 4.17.21
Fixed version: 4.17.21
Advisory: GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm
Description: Prototype pollution vulnerability allows an attacker to
modify Object.prototype leading to denial of service or remote code execution.
```

**What to do as a contributor when you see an alert:**

1. Read the advisory to understand the vulnerability scope
2. Check whether the project actually uses the vulnerable code path
3. The fix is almost always: update the dependency to the fixed version
4. Dependabot Security Updates may have already opened a PR - check the PRs tab

### Dependabot Security Updates

If enabled, Dependabot automatically opens a PR to update the vulnerable dependency. The PR will look like:

```
Title: Bump lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21
Author: dependabot[bot]
Description: Bumps lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21.
  - Release notes
  - Changelog
  - Commits (linked)
```

As a contributor with access, reviewing and merging these Dependabot PRs is a high-value, low-risk way to contribute.

### Dependabot Version Updates

Beyond security fixes, Dependabot can be configured to open PRs keeping all dependencies at their latest versions (not just security fixes). This is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

**Example `dependabot.yml`:**
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

## 3. Secret Scanning - Preventing Credential Leaks

Secret scanning detects if you accidentally commit tokens, API keys, passwords, or other credentials to a repository.

### Push Protection (Real-Time Prevention)

**Push Protection** intercepts a `git push` before it reaches GitHub and blocks it if it detects a known secret pattern.

If your push is blocked:

```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main.
remote: Push cannot contain secrets
remote: 
remote: - commit: abc123 in file: config.js
remote:   secret: GitHub Personal Access Token
remote:   location: line 5
```

**What to do:**

1. Remove the secret from the file immediately
2. Rotate the exposed credential (GitHub will automatically revoke detected GitHub tokens)
3. If it was a false positive, you can bypass with justification - but investigate first

**Best practice:** Use environment variables for secrets, never hardcode them. Example:

```javascript
// BAD - never do this
const token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// GOOD
const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;
```

### Secret Scanning Alerts

For public repositories, GitHub scans all existing commits and creates alerts for any detected secrets. These appear in Security → Secret scanning.

**Priority action:** If you find a secret scanning alert in a project you contribute to - especially a token or API key - treat it as urgent. The credential may have been exposed for a long time.

## 4. Code Scanning and CodeQL

Code scanning uses static analysis to find security vulnerabilities in the code itself (not dependencies). GitHub's built-in tool is **CodeQL**, which understands the code's logic and can detect:

- SQL injection risks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Path traversal issues
- Insecure cryptography usage
- Authentication bypasses
- Command injection risks

### Reading a Code Scanning Alert

```
Alert: Uncontrolled format string
Rule: py/tainted-format-string
Severity: High
File: src/utils/logger.py
Line: 47

Details:
  logging.info(user_input)  ← user_input flows unsanitized into format string
  
  Flow:
  1. User input enters at: request.args.get('message') [line 12]
  2. Passed to: logger.info(message) [line 47]
  3. Risk: format string injection if message contains %s, %d patterns
```

**As a contributor:** Code scanning alerts are excellent, well-scoped contribution opportunities. Each alert shows you the exact file, line, and the data flow causing the issue. Fixing it is often a one-line change.

### Where to Find Code Scanning Alerts

Security tab → Code scanning → filter by severity, rule, or file.

## 5. Private Vulnerability Reporting

When you discover a security vulnerability in a project, **never report it as a public issue**. A public issue immediately broadcasts the vulnerability to anyone who could exploit it.

GitHub provides **Private Vulnerability Reporting** - a disclosure form that sends your report only to the repository's security team, not to the public.

### How to Submit a Private Report

1. Navigate to the repository's **Security tab**
2. Select **"Report a vulnerability"** (this button only appears if the maintainer has enabled private reporting)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Title:** Short description of the vulnerability
   - **Description:** Detailed explanation, how to reproduce it, and impact
   - **Severity:** Your assessment
   - **Affected versions:** Which versions are vulnerable
   - **CVSS score:** Optional - the Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating
4. Submit - only the maintainers see your report

### The Responsible Disclosure Process

After you submit:
1. Maintainers acknowledge your report (typically within 1-7 days for active projects)
2. They may ask follow-up questions in the private advisory thread
3. They develop and test a fix
4. They request a CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposure) number from GitHub
5. They publish a new release with the fix
6. They publish a public security advisory - you may be credited as the reporter
7. The CVE is published publicly (usually 90 days after report or after the fix is released)

### What If the Maintainer Doesn't Respond?

If a maintainer doesn't respond within a reasonable time (30-90 days is the standard window):
1. Send a follow-up in the private advisory thread
2. Contact GitHub directly if the issue is critical (GitHub can assist with coordinated disclosure)
3. Follow the project's SECURITY.md for their stated disclosure policy

---

## 6. The SECURITY.md File

A `SECURITY.md` file at the repository root defines the project's security policy. It typically contains:

- **Supported versions:** Which versions receive security patches
- **Reporting instructions:** How to report a vulnerability (email, private advisory form, etc.)
- **Response timeline:** How quickly maintainers aim to respond
- **Disclosure policy:** When the project will publish a fix publicly

**accessibility-agents's security policy:** `community-access/accessibility-agents` has a `SECURITY.md` that points to GitHub's private advisory form. If you find a security issue in accessibility-agents - even a potential one - use the private advisory form rather than opening a public issue.

### Navigating to a Repository's SECURITY.md

From the repository:
1. Security tab → Policies section → "Security policy" link
2. Or directly: `https://github.com/owner/repo/security/policy`

Screen reader path:
```
Security tab → H → "Policy" heading → Link: "Security policy" → Enter
```

## 7. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

An SBOM is a machine-readable inventory of every component (libraries, packages, dependencies) in a software project. It is increasingly required by enterprise and government organizations for supply chain security compliance.

### Exporting an SBOM from GitHub

1. Navigate to the repository's **Insights tab**
2. Select **"Dependency graph"**
3. Select **"Export SBOM"** button (top right of the Dependency graph page)
4. GitHub generates a SPDX-format JSON file listing all dependencies with their versions and licenses

This export is useful when:
- Your organization requires SBOM documentation before adopting an open source dependency
- You're auditing a project's complete dependency chain
- You want to identify license compatibility for a commercial product

## 8. Screen Reader Navigation of the Security Tab

### Reaching the Security Tab

```
From any repo page:
Secondary navigation landmark → Tab through: Code, Issues, PRs, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security
Or: Focus Mode → G then S (GitHub shortcut)
```

### Navigating Dependabot Alerts

```
Security tab → select "Dependabot alerts" link
Alert list is a table: T (NVDA/JAWS Browse Mode) → navigate rows
Each row: Tab to expand → Enter to open full alert details
Inside an alert:
  H → navigate: Alert title, Package details, Description, References headings
  2 → jump between major sections
  Links → navigate to the GHSA advisory, the vulnerable package, the Dependabot PR
```

### Navigating Code Scanning Alerts

```
Security tab → select "Code scanning" link
Alert list: T to find the table → ↑/↓ to navigate rows
Open an alert: Enter
Inside the alert:
  H → Alert title, Description, Code flow, Steps headings

## 9. Security and Accessibility Agents

Accessibility Agents' `/security-dashboard` slash command gives you a quick security overview without visiting the Security tab in the browser:

```
/security-dashboard
```

**Sample output:**

```
## Security Dashboard - community-access/accessibility-agents

### Dependabot Alerts
- 0 Critical
- 1 High: actions/cache < 3.3.2 (fixed: 3.3.3)
- 2 Medium: misc dependency updates available

### Secret Scanning
- No active alerts

### Code Scanning
- Last scan: 2 days ago - 0 new alerts

### Dependabot PRs Open
- #47: Bump actions/cache from 3.3.1 to 3.3.3
  "Review and merge to resolve the High severity alert"

### Recommendation
Action needed: Review PR #47 (5 minutes - single file change)
```

**Workshop exercise:** Run `/security-dashboard` on your fork after Day 2. Review any Dependabot PRs open on the upstream `community-access/accessibility-agents` - merging one is a real security contribution.
