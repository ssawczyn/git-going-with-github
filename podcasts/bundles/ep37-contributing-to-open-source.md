# Git Going with GitHub - Audio Series

## Episode 37: Contributing to Open Source

**Series:** Git Going with GitHub
**Episode:** 37 of 44
**Audience:** Blind and low-vision developers learning GitHub and open source
**Estimated length:** 12-15 min

---

### Audio Production Direction

Generate a conversational two-host podcast episode about this topic.
The audience is blind and low-vision developers attending a two-day workshop on GitHub.

**Tone and style:**

- Welcoming and encouraging - many listeners are encountering these concepts for the first time
- Use spatial and structural descriptions, not visual references
- Say "navigate to" or "move to the section called" instead of "look for" or "you will see"
- Define technical terms on first use - do not assume familiarity with programming jargon
- Focus on deep conceptual understanding - explain WHY, not just HOW
- Share practical tips, common mistakes, and real-world context
- When describing keyboard shortcuts, say the full key names: "Control plus Shift plus P" not "Ctrl+Shift+P"
- Keep the conversation natural - two hosts discussing the topic, not reading a script
- Include at least one real-world analogy per major concept
- End with a brief summary of key takeaways and what comes next

**Episode focus:**

- Finding your first issue: good first issue, help wanted labels
- Scoping a contribution: what counts as a contribution
- The fork, branch, commit, PR workflow end to end
- Writing pull request descriptions that maintainers appreciate
- Building a sustainable contribution habit after the workshop

---

### Concept Coverage Checklist

## 1. What Is Open Source?

Open source software is software whose source code is publicly available. Anyone can read it, use it, and - in most cases - contribute to it. Contributions can include:

- Fixing bugs in the software
- Writing or improving documentation
- Filing bug reports that help maintainers understand problems
- Reviewing other people's changes and leaving thoughtful feedback
- Translating content into other languages
- Improving accessibility - adding alt text, fixing heading structure, testing with screen readers

The projects that power much of today's web infrastructure - operating systems, programming languages, screen readers, and developer tools - are maintained by contributors who started exactly where you are now.

---

## 2. Who Can Contribute?

Contributors come from all backgrounds, skill levels, and countries. A first contribution could be fixing a typo, adding a missing full stop, or filing a bug report that saves a maintainer hours of debugging.

Assistive technology users bring a perspective that most sighted, mouse-first developers cannot - you notice when heading structure is broken, when a button has no accessible name, or when a form cannot be completed with a keyboard. These are real, high-value contributions that improve projects for everyone.

You do not need permission to start. If a repository's issues are public, you can file a bug or suggest an improvement today.

---

## 3. What Makes a Good First Contribution?

A good first contribution is:

- **Specific** - it addresses one problem clearly, not a general "this could be better"
- **Scoped** - it does not try to fix everything at once; one PR, one problem
- **Described** - the PR or issue explains what changed and why, not just what
- **Tested** - for documentation, this means reading it aloud with your screen reader before submitting; for code, it means verifying the fix works

**Signs a contribution is too large for a first attempt:**
- The PR touches more than three or four files
- You need to understand the entire codebase to make the change
- The issue has been open for a long time with many comments suggesting it is complex

Start small. A well-executed small contribution is far more valuable than a large contribution that cannot be merged because it is out of scope.

---

## 4. Finding Something to Work On

Most open source projects label issues that are suitable for new contributors. Look for:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `good first issue` | Explicitly recommended for first-time contributors |
| `first-timers-only` | Reserved for people making their first contribution to this project |
| `help wanted` | Maintainers are actively looking for someone to pick this up |
| `beginner` or `easy` | Lower complexity than average |
| `documentation` | No coding required - writing or editing docs |
| `accessibility` | Directly relevant to AT users; high-value work |

**How to search:** On any GitHub repository, go to Issues → filter by label. Or use GitHub's global search: `label:"good first issue" is:open language:markdown` to find documentation issues across all public repositories.

---

## 5. Reading an Issue Before You Start

Before commenting "I'll take this" on an issue, ask yourself:

- **Is the description clear enough to act on?** If you are not sure what the problem is, ask a clarifying question before starting work.
- **Is anyone else already working on it?** Look for recent comments from others saying they are working on it, or an open PR that references this issue. If a PR exists, it may already be in review.
- **Is the issue in scope for me?** A documentation task does not require programming knowledge. A bug fix in compiled code may require understanding the codebase.
- **How old is the issue?** Very old issues (2+ years) may be stale or no longer relevant. You can ask the maintainer if it is still valid before investing time.

If the issue looks right for you, comment briefly to let the team know you are working on it: "I'd like to work on this. I'll open a draft PR shortly." This prevents duplicate work.

---

## 6. Making Your Contribution

### The Basic Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** - creates your own copy on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your computer (or open a Codespace - see [Appendix N](appendix-n-github-codespaces.md))
3. **Create a branch** - name it something descriptive: `fix/broken-link-setup-guide`
4. **Make your change** - edit the file, save, verify
5. **Commit with a clear message** - "Fix broken link in setup-guide.md line 34"
6. **Push to your fork**
7. **Open a pull request** from your branch to the original repository's default branch
8. **Respond to review feedback** - maintainers may ask for changes; this is normal and not a rejection

### Writing a Good PR Description

A PR description should answer:
- **What** did you change?
- **Why** was the change needed?
- **How** did you verify it works?

Example:
> Fixed a broken link on line 34 of `setup-guide.md`. The link pointed to `/docs/old-setup` which no longer exists. Updated it to `/docs/00-pre-workshop-setup.md`, verified the target file exists and the anchor is correct.

This gives the reviewer everything they need to approve quickly.

---

## 7. Getting Help

It is always acceptable to ask a question on an issue or pull request. Good questions:

- **Are specific:** "I'm trying to fix the broken link on line 24 of `setup-guide.md`. The link currently points to `/docs/old-setup`. Where should it point?"
- **Show what you tried:** "I searched the repository for the correct URL but couldn't find a file at that path."
- **Are polite:** Assume good intent from maintainers, even if they are slow to respond. Maintainers are often volunteers with day jobs.

If you opened a PR and are waiting for a review, it is appropriate to leave one polite follow-up comment after a week or two. Start with: "Hi, just checking in on this PR when you have a moment."

---

## 8. After Your Contribution Is Merged

When your pull request is merged:

- Your name appears in the project's **commit history permanently** - it cannot be removed
- The issue you fixed is closed
- You are officially listed as a **contributor** to this project, visible on the repository's Contributors page

This matters for your GitHub profile. Each merged contribution demonstrates real-world collaboration with a project team: you scoped a problem, communicated with maintainers, addressed feedback, and saw the work through. That record is visible to anyone who views your profile.

Over time, a series of contributions builds a portfolio that shows how you work - not just what you can do in isolation.

---

## 9. Building a Contribution Habit

The hardest part of open source contribution is starting. Once you have one merged PR, the next is easier - you know the workflow, you have proof it is possible, and you have already navigated the social dynamics of working with a maintainer.

**Practical habits:**

- **Keep a list** of projects you use and like. These are natural candidates for contributions because you already understand what they do.
- **File bug reports** when you encounter problems, even if you cannot fix them yourself. A clear, reproducible bug report is a real contribution.
- **Review other PRs.** Even as a new contributor, you can leave useful feedback: "Does this change affect screen reader users?" or "The example in the PR description is missing a step."
- **Set a low bar.** A contribution does not need to be impressive. A fixed typo merged into a project used by thousands of people is more valuable than a perfect contribution never submitted.

### Supplementary: GitHub Skills Catalog - continued learning

# Appendix Z: GitHub Skills - Complete Course Catalog

GitHub Skills is GitHub's free, self-paced interactive learning platform. Every course runs entirely inside GitHub - no external site, no separate login, no video. You copy a course repository to your own account, and an automated bot named Mona teaches you through real issues and pull requests.

This appendix catalogs every available GitHub Skills module, organized into learning paths that build on the skills you practiced in this workshop. Use it as a roadmap for continued learning after Day 2.

---

## How GitHub Skills Works

Each course follows the same pattern:

1. Navigate to the course URL and select "Start course"
2. GitHub copies the course repository to your account
3. Mona (GitHub's automated learning bot) opens an issue with Step 1 instructions within 20 seconds
4. You complete the task described in the issue (create a branch, edit a file, open a PR)
5. Mona detects your action, validates it, and posts the next step as a comment or new issue
6. Repeat until Mona closes the final issue with a completion message

All interaction happens through GitHub's standard interface. The screen reader navigation skills from this workshop - heading navigation, landmark jumping, issue and PR workflows - apply directly.

For detailed screen reader navigation instructions, see [Appendix U Section 3 (GitHub Skills)](appendix-u-resources.md).

---

## Integrating GitHub Skills into Your Learning Journey

### During the Workshop

Three courses are woven into Day 1. You set each one up during the block where it appears, work through Mona's steps alongside the learning room exercises, and finish before moving to the next block. No preparation is required beyond having a GitHub account.

### After the Workshop - Recommended Next Steps

1. **Finish any incomplete workshop courses first.** If Introduction to GitHub, Communicate Using Markdown, or Review Pull Requests are still in progress, complete them before starting new modules.

2. **Pick one path that matches your next goal:**
   - Want to contribute to open source? Start with Path 2 (Collaboration).
   - Want to automate your workflow? Start with Path 3 (Actions).
   - Want to code faster with AI? Start with Path 4 (Copilot).
   - Want to secure your projects? Start with Path 5 (Security).

3. **Work through one course at a time.** Each course takes 30-60 minutes. Spreading them across multiple days helps with retention.

4. **Use the workshop materials as reference.** When a GitHub Skills course asks you to create a branch or open a PR, the chapter guides from this workshop describe the same operations with screen reader instructions.

### Tracking Your Progress

GitHub Skills does not have a central dashboard for tracking completions. Use these strategies instead:

- **GitHub profile:** Completed courses appear as repositories in your account. Pin your favorites to your profile.
- **Repository list:** Filter your repositories by the "skills-" prefix to see all courses you have started.
- **Mona's final message:** When you finish a course, Mona posts a completion message in the final issue. Bookmark it.
- **This checklist:** Copy the list below into a personal note or issue to track which courses you have completed.
