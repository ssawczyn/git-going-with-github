# Git Going with GitHub - Audio Series

## Episode 41: Copilot AI Models

**Series:** Git Going with GitHub
**Episode:** 41 of 44
**Audience:** Blind and low-vision developers learning GitHub and open source
**Estimated length:** 10-12 min

---

### Audio Production Direction

Generate a conversational two-host podcast episode about this topic.
The audience is blind and low-vision developers attending a two-day workshop on GitHub.

**Tone and style:**

- Welcoming and encouraging - many listeners are encountering these concepts for the first time
- Use spatial and structural descriptions, not visual references
- Say "navigate to" or "move to the section called" instead of "look for" or "you will see"
- Define technical terms on first use - do not assume familiarity with programming jargon
- Focus on deep conceptual understanding - explain WHY, not just HOW
- Share practical tips, common mistakes, and real-world context
- When describing keyboard shortcuts, say the full key names: "Control plus Shift plus P" not "Ctrl+Shift+P"
- Keep the conversation natural - two hosts discussing the topic, not reading a script
- Include at least one real-world analogy per major concept
- End with a brief summary of key takeaways and what comes next

**Episode focus:**

- The AI models available in GitHub Copilot
- Comparing models: speed, quality, context window, strengths
- Which model to choose for different tasks
- Plan availability and model access
- How model selection affects suggestions and chat responses

## 1. Overview

GitHub Copilot offers access to AI models from multiple providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. The model you choose affects response quality, speed, and premium request consumption. Different models excel at different tasks - understanding these trade-offs helps you get better results.

**Models are updated frequently.** This appendix reflects the model landscape as of February 2026. For the latest additions and retirements, see the [GitHub Copilot changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/label/copilot/) and [GitHub's official supported models documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models).

## 2. How to Choose a Model

GitHub Docs organizes models by task. Match your task to the right model to get the best results without unnecessary premium request cost.

### General-Purpose Coding and Writing

For everyday tasks - code completions, explanations, refactoring, writing documentation.

| Model | Provider | Strengths | Cost |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| **GPT-4.1** | OpenAI | Fast, accurate code completions and explanations. Reliable default for most tasks. | Free |
| **GPT-5 mini** | OpenAI | Reliable for most coding and writing tasks. Fast and accurate across languages and frameworks. Also supports image input. | Free |
| **GPT-5.1-Codex** | OpenAI | Higher-quality code on complex engineering tasks like features, tests, debugging, refactors, and reviews - without requiring lengthy prompts. | 1× |

| **Raptor mini** | OpenAI (fine-tuned) | Specialized for fast, accurate inline suggestions and explanations. Optimized for completions. | Free |

### Fast Help with Simple or Repetitive Tasks

For quick answers, boilerplate generation, renaming, or lightweight explanations where speed matters.

| Model | Provider | Strengths | Cost |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| **Claude Haiku 4.5** | Anthropic | Balances fast responses with quality output. Ideal for small tasks and lightweight code explanations. | 0.33× |

## 4. Model Availability by Plan

| Plan | Free Models Included | Paid Models Available | Monthly Premium Requests |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Copilot Free** | GPT-4.1, GPT-5 mini, Raptor mini | None | 50 (monthly) |
| **Copilot Pro** | All 0× models | Most (Pro+ models excluded) | 300 (monthly) |
| **Copilot Pro+** | All 0× models | All models | Unlimited |
| **Copilot Business** | All 0× models | Most | 300 per user (monthly) |
| **Copilot Enterprise** | All 0× models | All models | Unlimited |

Models marked with a premium multiplier consume premium requests proportionally. For example, Claude Opus 4.6 (3× multiplier) uses 3 premium requests per message. Free models (0× multiplier) never consume premium requests.

---

## 5. Premium Requests and Cost Multipliers

| Multiplier | Impact | Example Models |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **0 (free)** | Never consumes premium requests | GPT-4.1, GPT-5 mini, Raptor mini |
| **0.25×** | Very low cost | Grok Code Fast 1 |
| **0.33×** | Low cost | Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini |
| **1×** | Standard | Claude Sonnet 4/4.5/4.6, GPT-5.1-Codex, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Codex variants |
| **3×** | High cost | Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Opus 4.6 |

**Tips for managing premium request usage:**

- Use **GPT-4.1** or **GPT-5 mini** (both free) for everyday questions, quick explanations, and simple completions - they're fast and capable
- Upgrade to **Claude Sonnet** or **GPT-5.2** (1×) only when the task genuinely requires deeper reasoning
- Save **Claude Opus** (3×) for the most demanding analyses - architecture decisions, complex debugging, sophisticated design review
- Use **Auto** mode (see below) and let Copilot allocate model selection intelligently

---

## 6. Switching Models in VS Code

### In the Chat Panel

1. Open the **Chat** panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`)
2. At the bottom of the chat input area, you'll see the current model name as a button (e.g., "Auto" or "Claude Sonnet 4.6")
3. Activate the model picker button - this opens a dropdown list of available models
4. Arrow through the list and press `Enter` to select a model
5. For screen reader users: the chat input will announce the newly selected model after switching

### In an Inline Chat Session

1. Open Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I`)
2. The model picker appears in the inline chat toolbar
3. Same interaction: activate the model button to switch

### Keyboard Note for Screen Readers

In the Chat panel, the model picker button is near the **bottom** of the chat view. If you're having trouble locating it:

- Tab through the bottom toolbar of the chat panel
- Listen for the model name announced - it appears between the "Attach" button and the send button
- Press `Space` or `Enter` to open the picker

---

## 7. Auto Model Selection

**Auto mode** (the default) lets Copilot choose the best model based on the type of request. It became generally available on December 10, 2025.

**How Auto works:**
- For simple questions, Copilot routes to a faster, lighter model
- For complex code generation or debugging, Copilot upgrades to a more capable model automatically
- For agent tasks, Copilot selects an appropriate Codex model
- You can see which model was used after each response

**When to override Auto:**
- You specifically need a model with certain capabilities (e.g., vision input with Claude Sonnet 4)
- You're managing premium request quotas and want to control costs
- You've found a particular model gives better results for your specific workflow or domain
- You're doing agentic work and want to explicitly use GPT-5.1-Codex-Max or GPT-5.2-Codex

To switch back to Auto from a specific model, re-open the model picker and select **Auto** at the top of the list.

## 8. Models Retiring Soon

GitHub regularly updates the model roster. Older model versions are retired when newer equivalents are available. When a model is retired, Copilot stops sending requests to it and falls back to newer alternatives.

**Already retired (as of February 2026):**
- Claude Sonnet 3.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7
- Gemini 2.0 Flash
- o1-mini, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini
- Claude Opus 4.1
- GPT-5 (base), GPT-5-Codex

To stay current, watch the [GitHub Copilot changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/label/copilot/) - model additions and retirements are announced there.
