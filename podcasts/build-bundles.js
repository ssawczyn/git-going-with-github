## Episode ${ep.number}: ${ep.title}

**Series:** Git Going with GitHub
**Episode:** ${ep.number} of ${total}
**Audience:** Blind and low-vision developers learning GitHub and open source
**Estimated length:** ${ep.duration || '10-15 min'}

---

### Audio Production Direction

Generate a conversational two-host podcast episode about this topic.
The audience is blind and low-vision developers attending a two-day workshop on GitHub.

**Tone and style:**

- Welcoming and encouraging - many listeners are encountering these concepts for the first time
- Use spatial and structural descriptions, not visual references
- Say "navigate to" or "move to the section called" instead of "look for" or "you will see"
- Define technical terms on first use - do not assume familiarity with programming jargon
- Focus on deep conceptual understanding - explain WHY, not just HOW
- Share practical tips, common mistakes, and real-world context
- When describing keyboard shortcuts, say the full key names: "Control plus Shift plus P" not "Ctrl+Shift+P"
- Keep the conversation natural - two hosts discussing the topic, not reading a script
- Include at least one real-world analogy per major concept
- End with a brief summary of key takeaways and what comes next

**Episode focus:**
