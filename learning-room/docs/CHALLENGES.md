# Available Challenges

Welcome to the **Challenge Hub** - your guide to leveling up your GitHub and accessibility skills! 

This document is your **single source of truth** for all workshop challenges. It connects to GitHub issues that are pre-assigned to you by your @username.

**Quick Start:**
1. Go to the **Issues** tab of this repository
2. Look for issues titled `Chapter X.Y: [Challenge Name] (@YOUR_USERNAME)`
3. Click to open YOUR issue
4. Follow the steps in the issue description and this hub
5. Open a PR that references the issue (`Closes #XX`)
6. Watch the magic happen - bot validation, auto-close, and you've leveled up!


### Facilitators and Admins

Are you managing this workshop? See [FACILITATOR_CHALLENGES.md](../../FACILITATOR_CHALLENGES.md) for:
- How to generate challenges for a new cohort
- Monitoring student progress in real time
- Understanding bot validation and automation
- Archiving and refreshing issues between cohorts
- Pre-workshop setup checklist


## How to Find Your Challenges

### Method 1: GitHub Issues Tab (Easiest)
1. Click the **Issues** tab at the top of this repository
2. Your challenges are assigned to you - filter by assignee (click your avatar)
3. Each issue title shows the chapter and challenge number
4. Click any issue to start

**Example:** You'll see an issue like:
```
Chapter 4.1: Create Your First Issue (@yourname)
Chapter 4.2: Claim a Challenge (@yourname)
Chapter 4.3: Ask a Question (@yourname)
```

### Method 2: Use Advanced Search
In the GitHub search bar at the top:
```
is:issue assignee:@yourname label:challenge
```

This shows all challenges assigned to you.

### Method 3: This Challenge Hub (Below)
Expand any chapter section below to see the full instructions. The hub is the **detailed reference** - issues are the **lightweight tracker**.


## Challenge to Issue Lifecycle

Here's the flow every time you complete a challenge:

```
1. FIND        → Spot your issue in the Issues tab
2. CLAIM       → Comment "I'm working on this!"
3. WORK        → Follow the steps in the issue + hub
4. PUSH        → Create a branch, commit, push (git)
5. OPEN PR     → Open PR that says "Closes #<issue_number>"
6. VALIDATE    → Bot checks your work automatically
7. FIX         → If bot finds issues, fix and push again
8. MERGE       → When bot says checks passed, merge your PR
9. COMPLETE    → Issue auto-closes, you move to next challenge!
```

Each step is explained in the issue description. The issue is your **contract with GitHub** - it proves you did the work.

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter 4: Working with Issues</strong> - 3 Micro-Challenges</summary>

> **Branch guidance:** Chapter 4 focuses on issue skills. You do NOT need to create a branch or edit any files for these challenges. All your work happens in GitHub issue threads. File editing and branches start in Chapter 5.

### Challenge Set

1. **Create your first issue** - file a new issue with a clear title and description.
2. **Claim a challenge issue** - comment on an existing beginner issue to claim it.
3. **Ask one clarifying question** - add a question comment on your claimed issue.

### Challenge 4.1: Create Your First Issue

1. Open the `learning-room` repository in your browser.
2. Navigate to the **Issues** tab.
3. Activate the **New issue** button.
4. Type a clear, specific title (at least 12 characters). For example: "Add missing contributor background paragraph in welcome.md".

2. Pick an issue that interests you and open it.
3. Read the description to understand what needs to be done.
4. Comment: `I'd like to try this!`
5. Note the issue number. This is the issue you will fix in Chapter 5.

### Challenge 4.3: Ask One Clarifying Question

1. Open the issue you claimed in Challenge 4.2.
2. Re-read the description. Think about what is unclear.
3. Post one specific question as a comment (for example: "Should I add the paragraph after the existing heading or create a new subsection?").

### Completing Chapter 4

Post a comment on your assigned Chapter 4 challenge issue with your evidence:

```text
Chapter 4 completed:
- Challenge 4.1: Created issue #[number]
- Challenge 4.2: Claimed issue #[number]
- Challenge 4.3: Asked question on issue #[number]
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can create an issue with a clear title and description.
- Student can claim a challenge issue in a public thread.
- Student can ask a useful question before starting implementation.

### If You Get Stuck

1. Re-open `learning-room/docs/CHALLENGES.md` and pick one beginner issue.
2. Use the issue search filter: `is:open label:"challenge: beginner"`.
3. If claim/comment fails, refresh and retry once.
4. Ask facilitator for a direct issue link and continue.

### Learning Moment

Issues are not just task lists. They are collaborative spaces where clear communication reduces confusion and prevents rework.

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter 5: Working with Pull Requests</strong> - 3 PR-Validated Challenges</summary>

> **Branch guidance:** This is the first chapter where you edit files and create branches.
>
> - **Web editor (recommended):** When you edit a file on GitHub.com and click "Propose changes," GitHub creates a branch for you. Name it `fix/yourname-issueXX`.
> - **Local Git:** Create a branch with `git checkout -b fix/yourname-issueXX` from `main`.
> - **Do NOT use your `username-practice` branch yet.** That is for Chapter 11 and beyond.

### Challenge Set

1. **Create one small branch change** - edit the file specified in your claimed issue.
2. **Open a linked PR** - use the PR template and include `Closes #XX`.
3. **Pass required checks** - respond to bot feedback until all required checks pass.

### Challenge 5.1: Create One Small Branch Change

Open the issue you claimed in Chapter 4.2. It tells you which file to edit.

The following table summarizes the practice files.

| File | What to fix |
|------|-------------|
| `docs/welcome.md` | Three `[TODO]` sections where content is missing |
| `docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md` | Intentional errors in shortcut references |
| `docs/setup-guide.md` | Broken links and incomplete steps |

**Using the web editor:**

1. Navigate to the file in the `learning-room` repository.
2. Activate the **pencil icon** (Edit this file).
3. Make your change (keep it small and focused).
4. Activate **Commit changes**.
5. In the branch name field, type: `fix/yourname-issueXX`.
6. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
7. Activate **Propose changes**.

### Challenge 5.2: Open a Linked PR

1. On the "Open a pull request" page, write a descriptive title.
2. In the body, include a summary of your change (at least 50 characters) and the line `Closes #XX` (where XX is your Chapter 5 challenge issue number).
3. Verify the base branch is `main` and the compare branch is your `fix/` branch.
4. Activate **Create pull request**.

### Challenge 5.3: Pass Required Checks

1. Wait about 30 seconds. The bot posts a validation comment.
2. Read the bot feedback. It checks: issue reference, description length, file location, and accessibility.
3. If the bot reports failures, edit the file again (directly on your branch via the Files changed tab pencil icon), fix the issue, and commit. The bot re-runs automatically.
4. Repeat until all checks show green checkmarks.
5. Request a review from a peer or facilitator.

### Expected Outcomes

- Student opens a focused PR that maps to one issue.
- Student uses `Closes #XX` correctly.
- Student can interpret bot feedback and improve the PR.

### If You Get Stuck

1. Confirm your PR includes `Closes #XX` in title or body.
2. Check that changed files are only in `learning-room/`.
3. Open the bot validation comment and resolve one required check at a time.
4. If checks still fail, ask for peer or facilitator review with the exact error message.

### Learning Moment

A great PR is small, linked to an issue, and easy to review. Faster feedback builds confidence and momentum.

<summary><strong>Chapter 6: Merge Conflicts</strong> - 1 Controlled Conflict Drill</summary>

### Challenge: Resolve Conflict Markers

**Sample file:** [`learning-room/docs/samples/chapter-6-conflict-practice-sample.md`](./samples/chapter-6-conflict-practice-sample.md)

1. Open the assigned merge-conflict practice issue.
2. Edit only the designated practice file/section.
3. Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and keep the intended final content.
4. Open PR with `Closes #XX` and complete with a short issue comment summary.

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can identify conflict markers immediately.
- Student can remove markers and keep intended content.
- Student can submit a clean, issue-linked PR after resolution.

### If You Get Stuck

1. Pause and read marker blocks line by line before editing.
2. Keep one side, or combine both sides when both lines are valid.
3. Delete all marker lines (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
4. Ask facilitator to sanity-check final content before opening PR.

### Learning Moment

Merge conflicts are not failures. They are a normal collaboration checkpoint and a chance to make an intentional content decision.

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter 7: Culture and Etiquette</strong> - Optional Guided Reflection</summary>

### Optional Guided Reflection (Issue Comment Evidence)

Students can post one short comment on their assigned issue:

```text
Chapter 7 reflection:
- One respectful review habit I will use:
- One way I will ask for help clearly:
- One way I will respond to feedback constructively:
```

This keeps learning visible without creating a pass/fail pressure point.

**Completion criteria:** Post one sentence for each of the three prompts.

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can name respectful collaboration behaviors.
- Student can prepare a constructive feedback style before review work.
- Student feels safer asking for help in public threads.

### If You Get Stuck

1. Use one simple sentence per prompt.
2. Focus on one real behavior you can do today.
3. If writing feels hard, draft bullet points first, then post.
4. Ask facilitator for one example response and adapt it.

### Learning Moment

Technical quality and communication quality work together. Respectful, clear communication helps good code get merged faster.

<summary><strong>Chapter 8: Labels, Milestones, and Projects</strong> - 1 Guided Triage Recommendation</summary>

### Challenge: Triage Recommendation Comment

**Estimated time:** 5-10 minutes

1. Open your assigned challenge issue.
2. Review issue title, description, and target file.
3. Post a triage recommendation comment using this format:

```text
Chapter 8 triage recommendation:
- Suggested labels:
- Suggested milestone:
- Suggested project board column:
- One-sentence reason:
```

4. If you have write access, apply the recommended labels/milestone directly.

This keeps the task simple and accessible for all students, including those without triage permissions.

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can recommend labels/milestone/project placement using issue context.
- Student understands triage even without maintainer permissions.
- Student leaves a clear, reusable triage note for maintainers.

### If You Get Stuck

1. Start with one label only (`documentation`, `bug`, or `accessibility`).
2. If milestone is unclear, write `none` and explain why.
3. If project board is unknown, write `needs triage` and continue.
4. Ask facilitator to review your one-sentence reason before posting.

### Learning Moment

Triage is about clarity, not authority. Good recommendations reduce maintainer effort and speed up collaboration.

<details>
<summary><strong>Chapter 15: Issue Templates</strong> - 2-3 Guided Template Design Challenges Using Registration Template</summary>

### Challenge Set

**Estimated time:** 2-2.5 hours (includes YAML learning and remix practice)

**Sample files used in this challenge:**
- Source template: [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workshop-registration.yml`](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workshop-registration.yml)
- Remix example: [`learning-room/docs/samples/chapter-15-registration-remix-example.yml`](./samples/chapter-15-registration-remix-example.yml)

The registration template you filled out on Day 1 is your teaching tool. It demonstrates YAML form-based templates with accessibility-first design.

1. **Analyze the registration template**
   - Open: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workshop-registration.yml`
   - Read the YAML structure: frontmatter (name, description, title, labels) and field types
   - Notice field types: input, dropdown, textarea, markdown
   - Observe: each field has a label, description, and validation rule
   - Compare: How is this better than a blank issue form?
   - Evidence: Short comment explaining one way the template improved contributions

2. **Remix the registration template for a new context**
   - Take the registration template structure and adapt it for a different use case
   - Keep the YAML pattern, change the context: (e.g., bug report, workshop feedback, accessibility audit)
   - Update: field names, labels, descriptions, and dropdown options
   - Create: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/my-template.yml` in your test repository
   - Commit and push
   - Validate YAML syntax before pushing (for example: <https://www.yamllint.com/>)
   - Evidence: PR or comment linking to your remixed template

3. **Optional: Create a Markdown template**
   - Create: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/my-markdown-template.md`
   - Write YAML frontmatter (same pattern as registration template)
   - Add Markdown body with 3-4 sections and HTML comment instructions
   - Test in the template chooser if your repository supports it
   - Evidence: PR or comment linking to your Markdown template

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can read and understand YAML form template structure
- Student can adapt a professional template to a new context
- Student understands why templates improve contribution quality and consistency
- Student can create both YAML form-based and Markdown templates
- Student recognizes accessibility-first design in form templates

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Can't find the registration template?** Look in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workshop-registration.yml` — that's the form you filled out to join.
2. **YAML structure confusing?** Start by copying the registration template. Modify only the field descriptions and labels first. Leave the structure intact.
3. **YAML not parsing?** Compare your file against the provided remix sample and validate indentation with two spaces per level.
4. **Not sure what context to remix for?** Try: bug report, feature request, workshop feedback, accessibility audit form, or event signup.
5. **Template doesn't appear in chooser?** Verify filename ends in `.yml` or `.md`, file is in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, and you pushed the commit. Try a fresh Issues tab reload.
6. **Repository permissions issue?** Ask facilitator for write access to a shared test repository.
7. **Want to see how it all works?** Ask facilitator to show you a template they created.

### Learning Moment

The best template is one you've already used. By remixing the registration template, you learned that template design is about pattern recognition and context adaptation, not starting from scratch every time. When you maintain a project later, you'll do this: analyze what worked, adapt it to your new context, then iterate. Professional templates exist because someone did this exercise and discovered what works. Your remix becomes their teachable example.

<summary><strong>Chapter 16: Accessibility Agents</strong> - 3-5 Guided Agent Exploration & Validation Challenges</summary>

### Starter Set (Use These First)

If 55 agents feels too broad, start with this sequence:
1. `@daily-briefing` (maps to repository navigation and issue awareness)
2. `@issue-tracker` (maps to Chapter 4 issue workflow)
3. `@pr-review` (maps to Chapter 5 and Chapter 14 review skills)

Once these feel comfortable, expand to specialist agents.

### Challenge Set

1. **Agent Discovery Mapping**
   - Read Section 3: The Ecosystem (55 agents across 3 teams)
   - Use the discovery framework: Skill you already have -> matching agent -> one safe first prompt
   - Match 3-5 agents to Day 1 skills you already have
   - Answer: *"I am ready for this agent because I have already [skill]"*
   - Evidence: Issue comment with your mapping (use `#16-agent-discovery` label)
   - Time: 20 minutes

2. **Agent Skill Validation**
   - Clone your fork of accessibility-agents repo
   - Open Copilot Chat and run one agent from your discovery list
   - Evaluate: Did the output match what you expected from manual experience?
   - Answer three evaluation questions in an issue comment (use `#16-agent-validation` label)
   - Time: 30 minutes

3. **Agent Instructions Deep Dive**
   - Read one `.agent.md` or `.prompt.md` file
   - Answer: What is this agent trying to do? What tools does it have access to?
   - Answer: Could this agent make a mistake? What kind?
   - Evidence: Issue comment with your analysis (use `#16-agent-internals` label)
   - Time: 15 minutes

### Optional Contribution Challenges (Day 2 Hackathon)

4. **Improve an Existing Agent** (45 min)
   - Find an agent gap or improvement opportunity
   - Edit the agent's instructions
   - Open a PR to accessibility-agents
   - Evidence: Your merged PR

5. **Propose a New Agent** (60 min)
   - Identify an uncovered workflow
   - File an issue with 3 example prompts
   - Discuss with maintainers
   - Evidence: Your issue with community discussion

### Capstone: Workshop Feedback (The Most Important Challenge!)

**This is not optional. Your feedback directly shapes the next cohort.**

6. **Share Your Experience - Workshop Feedback Form** (15-20 min)
   - You've completed (or are working through) two days with us.
   - Your constructive feedback helps us improve, helps future students, and teaches maintainers how to build better tools.
   - **This feedback will be read, discussed, and acted on.**
   - Open a new issue in git-going-with-github using the **Workshop Feedback** template
   - **Direct link:** [File Workshop Feedback](https://github.com/community-access/git-going-with-github/issues/new?template=feedback-workshop.yml)
   - Fill out as much or as little as you're comfortable sharing
   - No response is "wrong" - honest feedback is the only kind we want

   **What to cover (if you want to):**
   - Which agents were most useful?
   - Which agents confused you or didn't work as expected?
   - Did the chapter progression feel logical?
   - Was the workshop accessible to you? (screen reader users, keyboard users, neurodivergent learners, all welcome)
   - What concept will you remember in 6 months?
   - What should we change for next time?
   - Anything else? (Facilitator appreciation? Suggestions? Wild ideas?)

   **Evidence:** Your submitted feedback issue becomes part of our workshop archive and roadmap.

### Expected Outcomes

- Student can map Day 1 manual skills to specific agents in the ecosystem
- Student understands **Skill First, Agent Second** principle
- Student has used at least one agent in Copilot Chat
- Student can read and evaluate agent instructions
- **(Capstone)** Student has shared honest, constructive feedback that helps future cohorts
- (Optional) Student has contributed an improvement or proposal to the project

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Can't find matching agents?** Start with `@daily-briefing` or `@issue-tracker`—those build directly on Chapters 2-5.
2. **Agent output doesn't make sense?** That is valuable feedback. Paste it in an issue comment with your question. The error might point to a gap in the agent's instructions.
3. **Can't see agents in Copilot Chat?** Check: Is Copilot Chat extension installed (not just Copilot)? Are you signed in? Does `.github/agents/` folder exist in your cloned repo? Run `ls -la .github/agents/` to verify.
4. **Clone failed?** Use the terminal: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/accessibility-agents.git; cd accessibility-agents; code .`
5. **Feedback form feels overwhelming?** Answer just one question. Any feedback is valuable. Start with "What confused you the most?" - that's the most actionable for us.
6. **Still stuck?** Show facilitator: the agent you wanted to run, the output you got, and what you expected. They can verify setup.

### Learning Moment

The 55 agents exist because someone did the manual work first, then automated the repetitive parts. The principle **Skill First, Agent Second** exists to protect you: it keeps you from treating AI as magic. You already know the limits of automation because you have done the work by hand. That expertise lets you evaluate agents critically, catch their mistakes, and improve them. The agents that will exist in the future will be built by people in this room who saw a gap and filled it.

**Your feedback is the bridge between this workshop and the next one. Thank you for being honest. We are listening.**
